Tandem is a generational opportunity to rethink how we bring new therapies to market, and our path to doing so is significantly de-risked – we have:


 * Exponential organic growth: We have product-market fit and are growing rapidly through word-of-mouth. Tandem supports thousands of patients every day, is doubling doctor users every quarter, and is working with the largest biopharma companies in the world.
 * An AI-first business model: Our approach is distinctly enabled by AI, but our business will get stronger (not commoditized) as foundation models improve. We are building durability through two-sided network effects that will compound over time.
 * Top tier investors: With the traction to support conviction in our model, we raised significant funding from investors (Thrive Capital and General Catalyst) to build an exceptional team of engineers and operators.
   
   

Our number one priority is scaling to market demand. We are looking for individuals who are high horsepower, high throughput, and hyper resourceful to help us increase capacity and grow. We move fast and need to move faster.

All full-time roles are in person in New York. You can learn more about working with us in the last section of this page.

About The Role

As a Data & Analytics Engineer at Tandem, you’ll build the data foundation that powers how we operate, measure, and grow. You’ll design and maintain our core data models, pipelines, and reporting infrastructure — ensuring the right people have access to clean, trustworthy, decision-grade data at the speed we need to move. This is a cross-functional, impact-heavy role where you’ll work closely with product, ops, growth, and leadership to build the systems that enable better, faster decisions across the company.

You’ll also help define our data & analytics engineering practices: how we structure metrics, review code, manage pipelines, and build for scale. Your work will directly support everything from product usage visibility to operational performance to life sciences client reporting.

This is a demanding role, with a high level of autonomy and responsibility. You will be expected to ""act like an owner"" and commit yourself to Tandem's success. If you are low-ego, hungry to learn, and excited about intense, impactful work that drives both company growth and accelerated career progression, we want to hear from you.

If you join, you will:


 * Build and maintain the core data models that serve as the foundation for internal analytics and client-facing insights
 * Design and operate the data pipelines that transform raw sources into clean, analytics-ready tables
 * Create dashboards and reporting tools that drive performance visibility and decision-making across product, ops, and GTM
 * Define and enforce metric consistency across teams — including core business KPIs and product usage definitions
 * Help improve and scale our analytics stack (we use GCP BigQuery and Dataform, Fivetran, Postgres, and dashboarding tools)
 * Collaborate with stakeholders across teams to understand data needs and translate them into reliable systems
 * Contribute to internal data culture through documentation, education, and code quality standards
   
   

We’re looking for you if you have:


 * 3–6 years of experience in data engineering, analytics engineering, or a technical data analyst role with production ownership
 * Expert-level SQL and comfort working in a code-first environment (versioning, testing, documentation)
 * Experience designing data models that balance usability, performance, and long-term maintainability
 * Familiarity with the modern data stack — dbt, Fivetran, Airflow, GCP/AWS/Snowflake, Metabase (or equivalents)
 * Strong written and verbal communication that allows you to be an effective participant in both internal debates and external relationships
 * Track record of moving quickly, finding shortcuts, and going to unreasonable lengths to deliver on goals
 * High NPS with your former teammates
   
   

This is a list of ideal qualifications for this position. If you don't meet every single one of them, you should still consider applying! We’re excited to work with people from underrepresented backgrounds, and we encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.

We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.

About The Role

Rippling is building the future of how businesses run — and our Data Cloud team is on a mission to give every customer a full-stack data platform to understand and operate their business, across every function: HR, IT, Finance, and beyond.

We’re looking for a Data Analyst to join our product team — but this isn’t your typical analyst role. You won’t be sitting in a silo writing dashboards for exec reviews. Instead, you’ll be at the center of how we dogfood our own analytics products, solve real reporting needs for our internal teams (starting with HR), and translate those solutions into customer-facing templates, recipes, and product feedback.

If you’re the kind of person who’s happiest when you’re deep in SQL one minute, building dashboards the next, and collaborating with product managers to make tools better the minute after that — this is your role.

What You Will Do


 * Support internal reporting use cases: Be the go-to person for Rippling’s internal HR reporting needs — helping them define the right metrics, write the SQL, and build clean dashboards using our own reporting tools.
 * Productize real solutions: Take the reports and dashboards you build for internal teams and turn them into recipes or templates that any Rippling customer can use.
 * Shape the future of the product: Because you’ll be living in our product every day, you’ll become a key voice for what’s working and what’s not — surfacing gaps, proposing improvements, and even influencing the roadmap.
 * Be the “power user” of our data stack: Our team builds everything from ingestion to transformation to dashboards. You’ll be working across this full stack, helping make it more usable and scalable through your daily work.
 * Drive self-serve analytics adoption: Help internal teams (starting with HR) reduce their dependence on ad hoc requests by building the right dashboards and templates to unlock self-serve.
   
   

What Success Looks Like


 * Internal teams can get the reports they need faster — and without asking twice.
 * Your dashboards become models for how customers solve similar reporting problems.
 * Your feedback helps us make major product improvements.
 * We ship better data products because you’ve helped us dogfood our own tools thoroughly and thoughtfully.
 * You are seen as both a trusted reporting partner and a product-minded analyst who can bridge internal needs and customer-facing solutions.
   
   

What You Will Need


 * 3+ years working with data.
 * Proficiency in SQL and hands-on experience with data exploration and dashboarding tools (Looker, Mode, Tableau, etc.).
 * A strong sense of product empathy — you don’t just solve the problem, you think about how others could solve it too.
 * Experience working with People, HR, or GTM teams is a plus.
 * Comfort navigating ambiguity, unstructured questions, and imperfect data.
 * Bonus: familiarity with dbt, analytics engineering, or data governance principles.
   
   

Why This Role Is Special

This role lives inside the product team, not on a siloed analytics team. That means:


 * Your work directly informs how we build and improve our data products.
 * You’re empowered to propose ideas, templates, and workflows based on real usage.
 * You get to see immediate impact — both internally and externally — from what you build.
   
   

This is a great fit for someone who wants to stay hands-on with data, but also get exposure to product development and influence what we ship.

Apply if…


 * You love using data to unlock clarity for others.
 * You get excited by operational reporting — not just vanity metrics.
 * You want to be part of a team building powerful tools and using them every day.
 * You’re curious, self-directed, and opinionated about what great looks like.

About GenTube

Imagination to images in milliseconds. Already 10M+ monthly creations and accelerating. We believe AI creation is the next social medium — as big as video, as habitual as scrolling.




The Opportunity

We’re at the start of a generational shift. Just as YouTube unlocked the world’s videos and TikTok turned short-form into the default entertainment, GenTube is making AI creation the medium of our time. A billion people will move from passive consumption to active creation — and you’ll be one of the engineers building the ML backbone that makes it instant and magical.




The Founders

Josh and Mo scaled platforms to 100M+ users and led a $150M+ AI exit to Microsoft. Now they’re building the defining consumer AI company of the creation era. We’re well-funded with a long runway, and you’re joining the founding team.




The Role

You’ll own the ML systems that power instant, high-quality creation at scale. From sub-second inference pipelines to personalization engines, your work will define how billions experience AI creativity.

 * Relentless Experimentation — Ship new model variants daily; A/B test speed vs. quality; build feedback loops from user behavior to improve outputs.




What We’re Looking For

 * ML Engineering Depth — Experience shipping production ML at scale; strong with generative models (diffusion, LLMs, multimodal); PyTorch/JAX fluency; inference serving (Triton, Ray, TorchServe).
 * Systems & Infrastructure — Expertise in inference optimization, batching, quantization, model compilation; GPU infra (CUDA, memory management, multi-GPU serving); backend skills in Python/FastAPI, async systems, cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).
 * Product-Focused ML — Care about user experience, not just benchmarks; design for sub-second latency, graceful degradation, and delight.
 * Mindset — Startup DNA, fast-moving, scrappy; performance obsessed; quality focused; empathetic to creator intent and expectations.




Bonus

 * Built and scaled ML products for consumer apps
 * Experience with personalization or recommendation systems
 * Open source or side projects showing technical creativity




Why Join

 * Strong cross‑functional communication skills—comfortable collaborating daily with engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders.
 * An eye for detail, a zero‑defect mindset, and a bias toward action over theoretical perfection
 * Possess a strong bias for automation and can defend governance decisions that keep data and processes healthy as they grow.
 * Thrive in a fast‑moving, ambiguous environment where priorities can shift quickly.

Middesk makes it easier for businesses to work together. Since 2018, we’ve been transforming business identity verification, replacing slow, manual processes with seamless access to complete, up-to-date data. Our platform helps companies across industries confidently verify business identities, onboard customers faster, and reduce risk at every stage of the customer lifecycle.

Middesk came out of Y Combinator, is backed by Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners, and was recently named to Forbes Fintech 50 List and cited as an industry leader in business verification by digital identity strategy firm, Liminal.

The Role

We’re building AI-driven applications that power business onboarding, fraud prevention, and identity verification. With proprietary data assets and deep domain expertise, we’re uniquely positioned to create a new generation of ML-powered solutions for trust and risk.

We’re looking for a hands-on Machine Learning Engineer with strong Data Science expertise to take end-to-end ownership of the ML lifecycle: from feature design and model development, to deployment, monitoring, and iteration in production. Unlike larger organizations where responsibilities are split, you’ll have the opportunity to own models from concept to production while working closely with product managers, engineers, and data platform teammates who support and amplify your work.

This is a rare chance to join an earlier-stage company where you’ll have broad visibility and influence, and where your ML systems will have immediate and measurable impact on customers.

What You’ll Do


 * End-to-end ML ownership: Lead the full lifecycle of ML systems — feature engineering, model design, training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and iteration.
 * Collaborate with a strong team: Work alongside data engineers, platform engineers, and product teammates who ensure you have the infrastructure, data, and context to deliver.
 * Design & deploy production models: Build high-performance ML applications in risk, fraud, trust & safety, and compliance domains.
 * Keep models healthy in production: Proactively monitor, detect drift, and retrain to ensure long-term performance and reliability.
 * Experiment & learn: Drive online experiments, offline evaluation, and counterfactual analyses to prove impact.
 * Shape ML foundations: Contribute to the feature store, model management, training/serving pipelines, and best practices that scale ML across multiple use cases.
   
   

What We’re Looking For


 * 5+ years applied ML experience with proven impact in risk, fraud, trust & safety, compliance, fintech, or other high-stakes domains.
 * Track record of owning ML models end-to-end — from research and design to deployment, monitoring, and retraining in production.
 * Strong software engineering skills (Python, ML frameworks, deployment pipelines) and ability to write reliable, production-grade code.
 * Hands-on experience with ML infrastructure such as feature stores, model management, training/serving pipelines, and monitoring tools.
 * Comfortable as a senior IC: you can set technical direction, establish best practices, and mentor peers while collaborating effectively across teams.
 * Experience working cross-functionally with data engineers, platform engineers, and product stakeholders to bring ML systems to life.
 * Deep expertise in classification challenges such as imbalanced labels, sparse signals, cold start, and production version management.

OverviewApplication

Why Delphi?

At Delphi, we are redefining how knowledge is shared by creating a new medium for human communication: interactive digital minds that people can talk to, learn from, and be guided by.

The internet gave us static profiles and endless feeds. Delphi is something different: a living, interactive layer of identity. It carries your voice, perspective, and judgment into every conversation—so people don’t just read about you, they experience how you think.

Our Mission Is Bold


 * Make human wisdom abundant, personalized, and discoverable.
 * Preserve legacies, unlock opportunities, and scale brilliance across generations.
 * Delphi becomes everyone's living profile to show what you know.
   
   

We are trusted and loved by thousands of the world’s most brilliant minds from Simon Sinek to Arnold Schwarzenegger (interact with all of them here). We have tripled revenue, users, and Delphi interactions in the past 6 months - all organically through word of mouth. We plan to accelerate even further from here.

Delphi’s investors include Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund, Abstract Ventures, Michael Ovitz, Gokul Rajaram, Olivia Wilde, and dozens of founders from Lyft, Zoom, Doordash, and many more. Our team includes founders with successful exits and builders from Apple, Spotify, Substack and more.

Learn more about Delphi and this position by calling the CEO’s digital mind here

What You'll Do

Build our data platform from 0→1 - Architect Delphi's entire data stack from scratch and turn raw data into insights that drive every major decision

Unlock product insights - Track user engagement with onboarding, identify ""time to magic"" moments, and discover behaviors that drive long-term retention

Drive growth intelligence - Analyze user segments, define session success metrics, and predict what actions lead to upgrades, churn, or virality

Optimize financial performance - Monitor paid tier performance, compare Free vs. paid user behavior, and refine pricing dynamics and conversion pathways

Run continuous experiments - Design and execute tests to learn about product behavior and find our north star metrics (like Duolingo's 3-day retention discovery)

Who You Are

0→1 data builder - You've built data infrastructure from scratch at a high-growth startup and know what it takes to go from nothing to production-ready systems

Technical foundation - Strong Python and SQL skills with proven experience designing scalable data pipelines, ETL systems, and data warehousing (Redshift preferred)

Cloud-native mindset - Comfortable with AWS infrastructure and building production-ready systems with strong reliability and observability practices

Analytics translator - You create clear, actionable dashboards and reports that non-technical teams use to make critical decisions

Bonus skills - You have deep experience with Amplitude for event instrumentation, building funnels, and extracting actionable product insights. Experience with distributed processing (Spark), event-driven architectures (Kafka), recommendation systems, or data science workflows is a plus

Why You'll Love It Here

We work on hard problems. Our team is full of former founders, and entrepreneurial individuals who are taking on immense initiatives.

There is extreme upside. Very competitive salary and equity in a company on a breakout trajectory.

We push each other. Work from our beautiful Jackson Square office in San Francisco, surrounded by peers pushing to do their best work.

Benefits


 * Unlimited Learning Stipend: Whether it’s books, courses, or conferences, we want to support your growth and development. The more you learn and improve your craft the more effective we will be together.
 * Health, Dental, Vision: Comprehensive coverage to keep to take care of your health.
 * 401k covered by Human Interest.
 * Relocation support to SF (as needed)
   
   

If you’re looking for just a job, Delphi isn’t the right fit. But if you want to shape the future of human connection, scale wisdom for billions, and build something that will outlast us all - you’ll feel at home here.

About Reserv

Reserv is an insurtech creating and incubating cutting-edge AI and automation technology to bring efficiency and simplicity to claims. Founded by insurtech veterans with deep experience in SaaS and digital claims, Reserv is venture-backed by Bain Capital and Altai Ventures and began operations in May 2022. We are focused on automating highly manual tasks to tackle long-standing problems in claims and set a new standard for TPAs, insurance technology providers, and adjusters alike.

We have ambitious (but attainable!) goals and need people who can work in an evolving environment. If building a leading TPA and the prospect of tackling the long-standing challenges of the claims role sounds exciting, we can't wait to meet you.

About the role

As a data analyst in a well-funded Series B stage start-up, you will be defining our growth potential for years to come. You will be an integral part of Reserv's data team, working to uncover insights that drive better decisions across the company.

For this role, we are seeking an experienced data analyst with 3+ years of experience in an analytical role. You'll work closely with leaders across the organization to investigate performance trends, develop reporting tools, and help unlock the value of our data. If you are ready to mold the vision for Reserv's technology, join us on the journey.

What we need

We need you to do all the things typical to the role:


 * Build and maintain dashboards that provide actionable insights for executive and functional leaders
 * Develop robust Python- and SQL-based reports to support a deeper understanding of the claim lifecycle and operational performance
 * Collaborate closely with engineering and operations teams to understand source system structures and translate them into our standardized data model
 * Conduct analyses to investigate performance issues, identify root causes, and make recommendations to leadership
 * Serve as the primary technical liaison between the data team and key internal stakeholders, ensuring analytical solutions meet real business needs
 * Communicate ideas and solutions through clear, concise writing and presentations
 * Help influence the culture, values, and processes of a growing data team
 * Enjoy and have fun being creative and thinking outside of the box. You will need to draw on analogous situations you've worked on before, but we are not traversing well-traveled roads. ""Where we're going, we don't need roads!""
   
   

Requirements


 * 2–4 years of experience as an individual contributor in data analytics, business intelligence, or consulting
 * Strong proficiency in SQL (e.g., Postgres, BigQuery, or Snowflake) and experience working with large, structured datasets
 * Experience building reports or dashboards in Looker (preferred) or a similar BI tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Mode)
 * Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with the ability to distill complex data into clear, actionable insights
 * Excellent communication skills — able to summarize findings and present recommendations to senior leaders
 * Ability to collaborate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders in a fast-paced environment
 * Have a strong technical skillset but also the willingness and ability to take over tasks outside your core competency
   
   

Benefits


 * Generous health-insurance package with nationwide coverage, vision, & dental
 * 401(k) retirement plan with employer matching
 * Competitive PTO policy – we want our employees fresh, healthy, happy, and energized!
 * Generous family leave policy after 8 months of continuous work

 * Build an evaluation culture: automatic regression suites that run HDL compilers/simulators, measure behavioral fidelity, and detect hallucinations/constraint violations; model cards and experiment tracking (MLflow/Weights & Biases).
 * Partner deeply with hardware design, CAD/EDA, Security, and Legal to source/prepare datasets (anonymization, redaction, licensing), define acceptance gates, and meet compliance requirements.
 * Drive productization: integrate LLMs with internal developer tools (IDEs/plug‑ins, code review bots, CI), retrieval (RAG) over internal HDL repos/specs, and safe tool‑use/function‑calling.
 * Mentor & uplevel: coach ICs on LLM best practices, reproducible training, critical paper reading, and building secure‑by‑default systems.

 * 10+ years total engineering experience with 5+ years in ML/AI or large‑scale distributed systems; 3+ years working directly with transformers/LLMs.
 * Proven track record shipping LLM‑powered features in production and leading ambiguous, cross‑functional initiatives at Staff level.

 * Production Mindset - You’ve shipped ML systems that run in the real world. You write reliable Python, know your way around infra basics, and care about performance.
 * Data Agility - You’ve worked with messy data—scraping, parsing, cleaning, and transforming it into something your models can learn from.
 * Frontend Awareness - You’re not expected to be a frontend engineer, but you know how to make ML feel native in a modern React-based product.
 * High Ownership DNA - You see the problem, spec the solution, and ship. You don’t need permission—you need a challenge.

San Francisco, CA – On-site

$170k–$250k + equity




A venture-backed AI company is expanding its engineering group and looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to help push forward a new generation of decision-support products used in complex, data-heavy environments.




The team builds systems that analyse large, unstructured datasets and surface insights that help organisations make high-stakes choices more consistently. You’ll join a small group of engineers and researchers working on applied ML problems that combine pattern recognition, anomaly detection, language modelling and real-time data interpretation.




This is a hands-on engineering role where you’ll prototype, train, evaluate and productionise models that directly shape the product experience.




What you’ll work on

 * Designing and implementing ML pipelines for processing a wide variety of semi-structured inputs.
 * Training and adapting large language models to handle classification, extraction and reasoning tasks.
 * Developing methods to identify irregularities, inconsistencies and unusual patterns within customer-supplied data.
 * Improving the performance, latency and reliability of deployed models at scale.
 * Collaborating with software engineers to integrate new capabilities into customer-facing features.
 * Exploring new approaches in multimodal modelling, retrieval-augmented generation and adaptive learning systems.




Who you might be

 * Someone with professional experience in ML engineering, data science, applied research or similar.
 * Confident programming in Python and fluent with at least one modern deep learning toolkit.
 * Comfortable working with messy, real-world data rather than clean academic datasets.
 * Experience with information extraction, language models, anomaly detection or data quality modelling is valuable.
 * Interested in joining a company where the ML team has genuine influence over product direction.
 * Enjoys experimentation, iteration and solving problems that don’t have an obvious starting point.

(No strict requirement on years — strength of experience matters more than time served.)




Why this is different

 * You’ll work on technically challenging problems where accuracy genuinely matters.
 * The company is scaling quickly and investing heavily in expanding its AI group.
 * You’ll collaborate closely with product and engineering leadership, not sit in a research silo.
 * The environment is fast-moving, with opportunities to own projects end-to-end.
 * Generous salary, equity and benefits package.




Location & Work Style

 * On-site in San Francisco to support a highly collaborative engineering culture.
 * Hybrid flexibility may be available for senior hires already living in the Bay Area.

Engineering teams at companies use Raindrop to get alerts about silent failures with their AI agents. Raindrop sends alerts when AI agents misbehave and links straight to the events, so AI engineers can dig into the conversations or traces, understand the root cause, and fix it, fast.

Why It Matters

AI agents fail constantly in ways both hilarious and terrifying. Regular software throws exceptions. But AI agents fail silently, leaving engineers with almost no visibility into how their agents are actually performing.

The current status quo is sifting through millions of logs and trying debug flaky evals that just aren't matching real world results. Evals are like unit tests, they confirm your model got specific test cases right. But in the real world agents call thousands of tools, run for hours, and encounter millions of unpredictable actions.

That’s where Raindrop comes in. It learns the unique shape of each AI agent’s issues. Starting from presets like Laziness, Forgetting, or Task Failure, to automatically tuning itself to each agent.

With one click of a button, AI engineers start tracking issues or topics across 100% of their production data. They can see frequency over time, how many users are affected, relevant properties and more.

In order to process hundreds of millions of events, we gradually train small, custom models, private to each company, that learn to uniquely understand how their product is used.

As part of the early team, you’ll play a fundamental role in shaping the company - from making strategy and product decisions, to helping scale the team, to shaping the future of AI agents.

Our Investors

We’re backed by incredible investors including Lightspeed and leading AI companies including Figma Ventures, Vercel Ventures, founders of Replit (Amjad Masad and Michele Castata), Cognition (Walden Yan), Framer (Koen Bok and Joen van Dijk), Speak (Andrew Hsu), Notion (Akshay Kothari) and more.

To close that gap, we’re building the world’s first AI tutor: one that listens, speaks, adapts, and inspires, just like the best human teachers.

Our first product, Read with Ello, is already helping tens of thousands of kids each week learn to read. It listens as they read aloud, offers support when they stumble, and generates magical, personalized stories.

Now, we’re scaling that success into something even bigger: a complete AI teacher for all children. It’s a 1:1 tutor that combines language, speech, and memory to deliver interactive education for kids worldwide. We move fast and test directly with families to create products that kids love.

About The Role

We’re looking for an ML Engineer to join our 5-person applied ML team. Our team operates at the intersection of research and production, solving open-ended problems while delivering real-world products. We use the best tool for the job, whether that’s a novel machine learning model or software engineering fundamentals.

You’re excited to build an AI product that pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in education. You believe that great products and research strengthen each other. You’ll thrive here if you enjoy building scalable systems from the ground up and bringing research to life in real-world products. You’ll make an edit in your Jupyter notebook this week, deploy it on-device next week, and watch it bring smiles to kids’ faces a day later.

What You’ll Do


 * Own projects end-to-end from data through to production (e.g. conversational agents, learner adaptation, or speech perception)
 * Collaborate with learning experts and product engineers to translate research into an AI tutor that understands, adapts, and interacts with children everywhere
 * Build with the latest advancements in machine learning
   
   

About You


 * 3+ years of experience in AI/ML research or engineering, preferably with speech systems or LLMs
 * Proven track record across the modeling lifecycle: data acquisition, experimentation, evaluation, and productionization
 * Experience with Python, deep learning frameworks, and distributed computing
 * Proficiency in applied mathematics and linear algebra at the level where you can contribute to research discussions with a deeply technical team
   
   

Bonus points


 * Public projects that demonstrate technical creativity
 * Track record of publications in top machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc.)
 * Depth in low-latency inference at scale
 * Strong product intuition
   
   

We Look For Candidates Who


 * Have something to teach us
 * Have an urge to make a real impact on child development at scale
 * Take initiative and full ownership of their work
 * Prefer open and direct communication grounded in empathy to beating around the bush
 * Want to build meaningful relationships at work
   
   

Who You’ll Be Joining

Ello’s 5-person applied ML team includes some of the world’s foremost experts in their areas. For instance, our speech perception efforts are led by the co-authors of wav2vec. At Ello, they’ve built the world’s best child speech recognition system, beating Whisper. That ability to deeply understand child speech enables us to design magical experiences for early childhood learning. We work on a broad range of machine learning problems across agent reliability, learner adaptation, and multimodal perception. We collaborate closely with advisors from Stanford and top industry research labs (on a weekly basis, not in some hands-off way). We work in-person out of our San Francisco office and we’re big believers in face-to-face collaboration.

A note on immigration

We don’t shy away from sponsoring US visas and green card petitions. Our CTO and CEO have each gone through their own immigration journeys and are familiar with the challenges. We have successfully secured O-1 visas, H-1B transfers, etc. for Ello employees and retain top immigration counsel.

About Ello

Ello is a public benefit corporation on a mission to maximize the potential of all children. We’re currently around 45 people, headquartered in San Francisco, with offices in São Paulo, Brazil; Nairobi, Kenya; and New York.

Our team has deep expertise in artificial intelligence, K-12 education, and child development across institutions such as Stanford, Berkeley, Google, Apple, and more. We were part of Y Combinator’s W20 batch and are funded by world-class investors including Goodwater Capital, Homebrew, Reed Hastings, Common Sense Growth, Ravensburger, Project A Ventures, Reach Capital, Khosla Ventures, WndrCo, Visible Ventures, and K9 Ventures.

We’re a small, collaborative team that takes each other’s voices very seriously. Because our mission is to support all children, it is critical that our team is representative of the communities we work in; we place significant emphasis on ensuring diversity in our team and inclusion in our culture.

We feel enormously privileged to be one of the few companies that has the opportunity to take a shot at truly revolutionizing education with AI at this inflection point in technology. We don’t take it for granted, so we work quite hard to turn that vision into reality with urgency. We want to create an environment in which we can all be our best selves, use our strengths to take Ello forward, and develop our own skills. We want to have fun while working hard to do impactful things that we’re proud of – and we believe it’s possible to do both.\ \ Apply for this Job: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/ello/a648f188-a341-45d0-bc21-ab92699241bd","Over 200 applicants","Full-time","Entry level","Engineering and Information Technology","Education","$150,000.00/yr - $200,000.00/yr","","","40672724","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/machine-learning-engineer-at-ello-we-re-hiring%21-4315541187?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title","EASY_APPLY",""

 * Help drive millions of dollars of revenue growth
   
   

What You'll Bring

 * Scalability - You design and implement systems that are robust and scalable, ensuring they can efficiently handle future growth and evolving use-cases.
 * Bias for Action - You’re a catalyst and an accelerator. You’re constantly unblocking yourself and others while making strategic trade-offs.
 * Experience - 4+ years of experience in a Data/Analytics Engineering role, ideally in a product-facing capacity. Proficiency with dbt and airflow, and familiarity with cloud data warehouses.
 * Exposure to ML workflows - you've collaborated with data scientists or machine learning engineers to transform features, create training data sets, and deploy and monitor models
 * Track record of impact - you've shipped data products or infrastructure that meaningfully improved business outcomes and end user experiences

Location: San Francisco Bay Area

Type: Full-Time

Compensation: Competitive salary + early-stage equity

Backed by 8VC, we're building a world-class team to tackle one of the industry’s most critical infrastructure problems.

About The Role

We’re building a multi-tenant, AI-native platform where enterprise data becomes actionable through semantic enrichment, intelligent agents, and governed interoperability. At the heart of this architecture lies our Data Fabric — an intelligent, governed layer that turns fragmented and siloed data into a connected ontology ready for model training, vector search, and insight-to-action workflows.

We're looking for engineers who enjoy hard data problems at scale: messy unstructured data, schema drift, multi-source joins, security models, and AI-ready semantic enrichment. You’ll build the backend systems, data pipelines, connector frameworks, and graph-based knowledge models that fuel agentic applications.

If you've worked on streaming unstructured pipelines, built connectors into ugly legacy systems, or mapped knowledge graphs that scale — this role will feel like home.

Responsibilities


 * Build highly reliable, scalable data ingestion and transformation pipelines across structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data sources
 * Develop and maintain a connector framework for ingesting from enterprise systems (ERPs, PLMs, CRMs, legacy data stores, email, Excel, docs, etc.)
 * Design and maintain the data fabric layer — including a knowledge graph (Neo4j or Puppygraph) enriched with ontologies, metadata, and relationships
 * Normalize and vectorize data for downstream AI/LLM workflows — enabling retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and alerting
 * Create and manage data contracts, access layers, lineage, and governance mechanisms
 * Build and expose secure APIs for downstream services, agents, and users to query enriched semantic data
 * Collaborate with ML/LLM teams to feed high-quality enterprise data into model training and tuning pipelines
   
   

What We’re Looking For

Core Experience:


 * 5+ years building large-scale data infrastructure in production environments
 * Deep experience with ingestion frameworks (Kafka, Airbyte, Meltano, Fivetran) and data pipeline orchestration (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect)
 * Comfortable processing unstructured data formats: PDFs, Excel, emails, logs, CSVs, web APIs
 * Experience working with columnar stores, object storage, and lakehouse formats (Iceberg, Delta, Parquet)
 * Strong background in knowledge graphs or semantic modeling (e.g. Neo4j, RDF, Gremlin, Puppygraph)
 * Familiarity with GraphQL, RESTful APIs, and designing developer-friendly data access layers
 * Experience implementing data governance: RBAC, ABAC, data contracts, lineage, data quality checks
   
   

Mindset & Culture Fit:


 * You’re a system thinker: you want to model the real world, not just process it
 * Comfortable navigating ambiguous data models and building from scratch
 * Passionate about enabling AI systems with real-world, messy enterprise data
 * Pragmatic about scalability, observability, and schema evolution
 * Value autonomy, high trust, and meaningful ownership over infrastructure
   
   

Bonus Skills

Prior work with vector DBs (e.g. Weaviate, Qdrant, Pinecone) and embedding pipelines

Experience building or contributing to enterprise connector ecosystems

Knowledge of ontology versioning, graph diffing, or semantic schema alignment

Familiarity with data fabric patterns (e.g. Palantir Ontology, Linked Data, W3C standards)

Familiar with fine-tuning LLMs or enabling RAG pipelines using enterprise knowledge

Experience enforcing data access policy with tools like OPA, Keycloak, Snowflake row-level security

Why This Role Matters

Agents are only as smart as the data they operate on. This role builds the foundation — the semantic, governed, connected substrate — that makes autonomous decision-making and agent action possible. From factory ERP records to geopolitical news alerts, the data fabric unifies it all.

If you're excited to tame complexity, unify chaos, and power intelligent systems with trusted data — we’d love to hear from you.

We're an early-stage stealth startup building a new kind of platform for generative media. Our mission is to enable the future of real-time generative applications: we're building the foundational tools and infrastructure that make entirely new categories of generative experiences and applications finally possible.

We're a small, focused team of ex-YC and unicorn founders and senior engineers with deep experience across 3D, generative video, developer platforms, and creative tools. We're backed by top-tier investors and top angels, and we're building a new technical foundation purpose-built for the next era of generative media.

We're operating at the edge of what's technically possible: high-performance inference and real-time orchestration of multimodal models. As one of our founding engineers, you'll play a key role in architecting the core platform, shaping system design decisions, and owning critical infrastructure from day one.

If you're excited about architecting and building high-performance infrastructure that empowers the next generation of developers and unlocks entirely new products categories, we'd love to talk.

About The Role

We're looking for a Founding Machine Learning Engineer to build the core infrastructure powering high-performance inference for generative media models, including diffusion and transformer architectures.

As an early technical leader, you'll shape both our systems and culture from day one.

What You'll Do


 * Architect and implement the inference engine for diffusion transformer-based generative models
 * Optimize model execution across the stack — memory, compute, and networking
 * Drive performance engineering to minimize latency and maximize throughput
 * Work closely with research to productionize new generative techniques and model variants
 * Build the tools, services, and monitoring that make these systems robust and scalable
 * Set the technical bar and help define engineering culture as an early team member
   
   

Requirements

About You


 * 3+ years of experience building high-performance ML or systems infrastructure
 * Deep fluency with PyTorch and production-grade Python
 * Strong understanding of GPU systems (CUDA, memory hierarchies, scheduling, etc.)
 * Experience optimizing inference for generative models (e.g., diffusion, transformers)
 * Bonus: Familiarity with Triton, CUDA, TensorRT, or model parallelism techniques
 * Startup-ready: you take ownership, move quickly, and solve hard problems end to end
   
   

Minimum Qualifications


 * Strong Python + PyTorch skills
 * Proven experience optimizing inference for generative models
 * Deep systems knowledge, especially GPU performance tuning
 * High agency and eagerness to build from scratch

Type: Full-Time

Compensation: Competitive salary + early-stage equity

Backed by 8VC, we’re building a world-class team to tackle one of the industry's most critical infrastructure problems.

About The Role

We’re building an AI-native platform where industrial data becomes actionable through semantic enrichment, intelligent agents, and governed interoperability. At the heart of this architecture lies our Data Fabric — an intelligent, governed layer that unifies fragmented and siloed data streams into knowledge graphs ready for high context decision-making and agentic execution.

The Data Partnerships Analyst will be on the front lines of this strategy: researching, evaluating, and supporting partnerships with leading data providers (trade, compliance, entity mapping, financial, ESG, geopolitical, etc). You’ll play a critical role in mapping data ecosystems, structuring partnerships, and ensuring Fabrion’s platform is powered by the most complete, high-quality, and strategically differentiated data.

This role is ideal for someone with sharp analytical skills, a curiosity for data-driven businesses, and a strong interest in how AI and partnerships intersect to transform global value chains.

Responsibilities


 * Market Landscaping & Research: Identify, track, and evaluate relevant data providers across global markets.
 * Deal Support: Assist in structuring partnership discussions, including preparing briefs, evaluating contract terms, and surfacing risks or dependencies.
 * Data Evaluation: Assess sample datasets for coverage, quality, refresh frequency, schema design, and interoperability with Fabrion’s knowledge graphs.
 * Partnership Pipeline: Maintain CRM-style tracking of outreach, engagements, and deal status across priority providers.
 * Competitive Intelligence: Benchmark competitors’ data strategies and build landscape views of potential threats and opportunities.
 * Cross-Team Collaboration: Work with product, engineering and legal teams to translate data partnership requirements into technical and contractual frameworks.
   
   

Core Experience

What We’re Looking For


 * 3+ years experience in research, consulting, corporate strategy, business development or partnerships.
 * Experience in the automotive industry, particularly at an OEM and/or Tier 1 supplier, is a huge plus.
 * Strong analytical skills; comfort with messy datasets, Excel/Sheets, and SQL/Python basics.
 * Excellent communication and synthesis skills — able to distill complex market landscapes into crisp takeaways.
 * Exposure to B2B SaaS, data vendors, or enterprise technology ecosystems preferred.
   
   

Mindset


 * Systems thinker: curious about how fragmented datasets connect into real-world decision and execution systems.
 * Comfortable navigating ambiguity and building processes from scratch.
 * High ownership: proactive, organized, and reliable in pushing workstreams forward.
 * Excited to work closely with founders and investors in a fast-paced, high-stakes environment.
   
   

Bonus Skills


 * Prior experience evaluating or working with data providers (e.g., S&P, D&B, etc).
 * Understanding of trade data, entity mapping, risk and compliance frameworks (REACH, RoHS, ESG, sanctions).
 * Familiarity with data licensing, APIs, or data feeds.
 * Prior exposure to supply chain, automotive, or industrial domains.
   
   

Why This Role Matters

Our platform’s intelligence is only as strong as the data it is built on. The Data Partnerships Analyst helps ensure Fabrion gains early access to the most critical and differentiated data sources.

This role gives you direct exposure to startup founders, investors, and senior executives at leading data providers. You’ll develop a unique perspective at the intersection of data, AI, and industrial transformation, while shaping the partnerships that power Fabrion’s AI agents.

If you’re excited to map the global data landscape, help secure strategic partnerships, and build the foundation of an AI-native enterprise platform, we’d love to hear from you!
