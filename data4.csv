The User Operations team is central to ensuring that our customers' experience with our products is nothing short of exceptional.

We work closely with Sales, Technical Success, Product, Engineering and others to deliver the best possible experience to our customers at scale. OpenAI's customers represent a range of diverse backgrounds and maturity, from early-stage startups to established global enterprises. Given OpenAI’s breakneck shipping cadence and growth—and the expectation that it will only accelerate—transforming our rich support data into real‑time insights and scalable, self‑serve analytics is critical to sustaining exceptional customer experiences on the path to AGI.

About The Role

We’re seeking a User Operations Data Analyst who will dig deep into user‑support data—surfacing trends, volumes, and friction signals—and turn these findings into actionable insights and always‑on reporting. You’ll design, build, and maintain self‑serve dashboards that keep every stakeholder informed in real time, partnering closely with Data Science and Engineering to ensure clean pipelines, robust models, and scalable tooling. Think proactive friction detection and real‑time service‑health views that help us stay ahead of demand—delivering decision‑grade insights, not just prettier slide decks.

This role is based in San Francisco, California. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


 * Explore large support and product datasets to uncover trends, volume drivers, and user‑experience pain points, distilling findings into clear, actionable narratives.
 * Build, enhance, and maintain self‑serve dashboards and reporting tools, enabling non‑technical teams to answer their own data questions.
 * Establish a unified metrics taxonomy for service‑health and performance—and build automated data‑sharing pipelines and scorecards with our BPO partners to ensure everyone operates from the same real‑time view of success
 * Leverage LLMs to build bespoke classifiers that automatically label and segment inbound volumes—powering smarter routing, richer self‑serve insights, and swifter root‑cause analysis.
 * Partner with Data Engineering to ensure reliable pipelines, implement data‑quality checks, and document sources of truth.
 * Jump into high‑priority special projects to conduct bespoke deep‑dive analyses and deliver clear, strategic recommendations to leadership.
 * Prototype quickly—leveraging ChatGPT, Jupyter notebooks, Retool, and other tools—to prove value before hardening with Engineering.
 * Collaborate with Data Science on predictive models and experimentation, translating results into operational recommendations.
   
   

You Might Thrive In This Role If You


 * 8 + years in analytics, business intelligence, or data science, ideally supporting customer support or operations teams.
 * Expert‑level SQL skills and proficiency in Python or R for advanced analysis and automation
 * Hands‑on experience designing and maintaining BI dashboards (e.g. Looker, Mode, Tableau, Sundial) with a focus on clarity and self‑serve usability.
 * Hands‑on experience fine‑tuning or prompt‑engineering LLMs to build text classifiers, sentiment analysis, or tagging systems.
 * Demonstrated ability to translate complex datasets into clear business stories and recommendations for both technical and non‑technical audiences.
 * Familiarity with support metrics (SLAs, FCR, deflection) and ability to define service health KPIs.
 * Strong cross‑functional communication skills—comfortable collaborating daily with engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders.
 * An eye for detail, a zero‑defect mindset, and a bias toward action over theoretical perfection
 * Possess a strong bias for automation and can defend governance decisions that keep data and processes healthy as they grow.
 * Thrive in a fast‑moving, ambiguous environment where priorities can shift quickly.

Reports to: Head of GenAI Content

Location: New York or Philadelphia (Hybrid)

Please include a cover letter outlining your interest in the role and how your skills align with AppliedXL and send to support@appliedxl.com.




About AppliedXL

AppliedXL is redefining how information powers decisions in the age of AI. As more work flows through machines first, data must be structured, contextual, and trusted. We turn raw information into verified, machine-readable signals that help analysts and AI systems detect what’s changing, before it becomes news. 




Starting with biotech, life sciences, and healthcare, our platform surfaces early risks and opportunities weeks ahead of disclosure. Our mission is to deliver news before it becomes news, building the standard for structured intelligence that powers high-stakes decisions across finance, healthcare, and beyond.




By joining AppliedXL, you’ll help shape the trusted signals that humans and machines rely on to see ahead.




The Role

This role sits at the point where data, biotech expertise, and AI reasoning meet. You’ll practice analytical storytelling for decision-makers, translating scientific and regulatory signals into insights that help investors and biopharma teams understand what’s shifting and why it matters.




Your work will blend data exploration, editorial judgment, and AI-assisted analysis. You’ll uncover patterns in public datasets, decide what is genuinely newsworthy, and turn those findings into clear, concise explanations that highlight risk, opportunity, and strategic impact.




You will collaborate closely with the Head of GenAI Content to define how humans and AI work together to detect emerging signals and explain them in concise, high-impact formats. Over time, you will take increased ownership of editorial pipelines, signal quality, and content accuracy across feeds and reports.




This role suits someone who enjoys turning complex clinical and regulatory data into sharp, insightful stories for informed readers.




What You’ll Do

Detect & Understand

 * Build working knowledge of datasets spanning clinical trials, regulatory filings, and biotech disclosures.
 * Translate complex data and workflows into clear, relevant insights for investors, biopharma stakeholders, and internal users.
 * Connect emerging signals to real-world outcomes, identifying what is genuinely newsworthy versus background noise.
 * Collaborate with product and GTM teams to define what “matters” from a user and audience perspective.




Interpret, Explain & Write

 * Explore structured datasets to identify trends, anomalies, and outliers that could signal emerging stories.
 * Assess what data changes mean in practice and how they map to risk, opportunity, or strategic shift.
 * Draft short, structured outputs (headlines, briefs, explainers, feed items) that summarize complex developments with clarity and precision.
 * Form editorial hypotheses, pressure-test them against the data, and maintain a high bar for analytical clarity and explainability.




Guide AI Reasoning

 * Develop and test prompts that detect scientific or regulatory significance in clinical and regulatory updates.
 * Evaluate AI outputs for factual accuracy, editorial quality, and narrative usefulness.
 * Document prompt behavior and edge cases to ensure reproducibility and transparency.
 * Bridge human and AI logic to improve how systems reason, prioritize, and communicate potential stories.




Integrate & Scale

 * Use internal tools to transform raw data into structured, user-facing intelligence and narratives.
 * Apply foundational AI concepts (model reasoning, tokenization, prompt design) in daily editorial workflows.
 * Document and share best practices for scalable human–AI collaboration in data journalism.
 * Continuously refine and QA editorial quality and AI output across the pipeline that turns raw data → structured insight → actionable foresight.
   

What We’re Looking For
 * At least 2+ years of direct experience in biosciences or clinical trials, and 5+ years total professional experience across life sciences, journalism, consulting, data analysis.
 * Experience working with data in a reporting, analysis, or research context, ideally with clips or samples that show your ability to explain complex topics.
 * Strong analytical and reasoning skills.
 * Familiarity with Python and/or SQL for data exploration and story discovery.
 * Experience with AI tools including language models, prompt engineering, LangChain, and/or RAG (retrieval-augmented generation).
 * Deep curiosity about how scientific and regulatory data becomes intelligence, and how AI can enhance that process.
 * Comfort linking scientific or regulatory developments to real-world business consequences such as investor reaction, competitive dynamics, or operational impact.
 * Proven ability to learn new domains quickly and explain complex ideas clearly to non-specialists.
 * Editorial instincts: you know how to question, frame, prioritize, and contextualize information for clarity and relevance.
 * Intellectual rigor about AI: you care not just about what models output, but why and how they reason.

Part engineer, part product thinker, part hacker. 100% user obsessed

Full-time or Contract, Remote or NYC, $100K - $150K + Equity




Context

We're building Nora, the personal shopping retriever loyal only to you.




Online shopping gave us infinite choice but zero tools to manage it. So people improvise with 47 browser tabs, screenshots flooding their camera roll, and links texted to themselves. They're drowning in options, missing price drops, and spending hours on research that leads nowhere.




Nora changes everything. Your personal shopping assistant that captures what you browse, what you buy, tracks prices, finds alternatives, verifies reviews, and soon will even negotiate deals on your behalf. All while keeping your data private and eventually earning you money.




Why this matters: We're shifting power back to consumers. For the first time, shoppers will have an AI assistant as sophisticated as what billion-dollar companies use. When you ask ""Should I buy this?"" Nora actually knows your style, budget, and what you've been considering.




Where we are: Just raised $750K from Betaworks & angels. Small team moving fast. Building something people desperately need. We’ve built the capture → memories → knowledge pipeline; now we need someone to make it truly smart and to power the agents that work on the user’s behalf.




Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=yULgS3qRWOA for more info.




The Real Job

You'll be the bridge between messy real-world shopping behavior and an assistant that actually understands and works for each user.

This isn't about research in a vacuum or building an internal ML platform. You'll be:

 * Turning noisy data (DOM, clicks, scrolls, screenshots, receipts) into clean, structured memory about each shopper.
 * Teaching Nora everything from “what brands I love” to “my shoe size at different stores” to “what price I consider expensive.”
 * Building agents that go do the work: finding better places to buy, researching alternatives, checking reviews, and surfacing what matters.
 * Shipping intelligence that shows up as real product features, not just dashboards.

Your success = shoppers saying “Nora knows me and does the boring work for me.”




What You'll Actually Do Day-to-DayBuild Nora’s Understanding of Each User
 * Model user tastes, sizes, favorite brands, and price sensitivity from behavior.
 * Use LLMs and embeddings to turn raw capture into entities, attributes, and preferences.
 * Improve our capture → memories → knowledge pipeline so it gets cleaner, richer, and more personal over time.

Build Nora’s Agents
 * Design agents that can:
 * Find alternative places to buy the same product.
 * Suggest similar items that better match the user’s constraints.
 * Check reviews and flag sketchy listings.
 * Track meaningful price changes and surface them at the right time.
 * Wire LLMs to tools and structured data so agents are fast, reliable, and explainable.

Ship Product, Not Just Models
 * Work directly with the founder, designer, and Head of User Love (no PM layer).
 * Watch real users shop with Nora, then adjust models and agents based on what you see.
 * Prototype quickly, run small experiments, and ship improvements weekly.
 * Own the full loop: data → model → API → UI → metrics.

You're Our Person If...You've Done This Before (In Some Form)
 * 2–8+ years working in applied ML / LLMs / search / recommendations / personalization.
 * Shipped at least one real system that powered search, recs, ranking, or an LLM-based feature in production.
 * Comfortable with both modeling and the surrounding engineering (data pipelines, APIs, evaluation).

You Think Like This
 * “We should measure success in user behavior, not just offline metrics.”
 * “We don’t need a bigger model yet—just better features and feedback loops.”
 * “Let’s prototype this as a small agent flow and then harden what works.”

You Work Like This
 * Comfortable with ambiguity (we’re figuring this out together).
 * Can go from idea → prototype → shipped experiment in days, not quarters.
 * Enjoy pairing with designers and user researchers, not just other engineers.




Why This Role Matters

Shopping online is broken. People have 47 tabs open, screenshots everywhere, links lost in texts. They're recreating the same searches daily, missing price drops, buying the wrong size.

We already capture that behavior and turn it into memory.

You’ll make that memory intelligent and build the agents that act on it.

You’ll help us fix shopping for millions of people—not with committees and roadmaps, but by building systems that know users deeply and quietly do work on their behalf.




Why Nora?Build Something New

We’re not just optimizing conversion funnels. We’re creating a new layer for shopping: a personal memory and agent that answers to the user, not the retailer.

Meaningful Equity

Real ownership in something that could change how people shop online. You’re early enough that your equity will matter.

Choose Your Setup

Remote, in-person NYC, or hybrid. Full-time or contract. We care about impact, not hours logged.

Our mission is to maximize health outcomes globally by building a scalable AI platform that screens patients comprehensively using electronic health records (EHRs), labs, clinical notes, and more.

We're experiencing explosive growth, with contracts and pilots at top US health systems like Cedars-Sinai, Intermountain Health, Penn Medicine, and many others. We have unprecedented access to EHR data (far more than competitors: 10s of billions of tokens per hospital + vast structured data across 100% of inpatients), positioning us to expand into additional conditions like pressure ulcers, congestive heart failure, infections, readmissions, and mortality predictions. With a unique strategy and no direct competitors (due to our 2+ year lead and regulatory advantages), we are setting out to become a $100B+ company.

Outcomes You’ll Drive

Condition expansion velocity: Idea → signal & label viability using current EHR data → validated model → customer-ready (for viable use cases, weeks, not months)

Improving patient health outcomes: Quantified length of stay (LOS) reduction, readmission reduction, mortality reduction, with clear confidence intervals and robust counterfactuals.

Pilot → production conversion: Run retrospective analyses on hospital data to prove impact, then transition validated pilots into live deployments that deliver measurable outcomes.

Role Overview

We’re looking to hire a product-minded Data Scientist with a sound theoretical knowledge foundation. You will own end-to-end problem framing, timeline scoping, experimental design, and model iteration. You'll work closely with our CEO and small team to launch new models quickly and safely by leveraging and expanding on our existing feature tables. You will also run retrospective pilots to estimate clinical and financial impact (reimbursement lift, LOS reduction, mortality reduction) and support pre-sales by meeting AI/Data Science leaders at world-class health systems to share your clinical and financial model assumptions and development methodologies.

Key Responsibilities


 * Own end-to-end modeling from financial incentives and problem framing to a validated model.
 * Estimate impact with rigorous retrospective analyses (LOS, readmissions, mortality, reimbursement).
 * Productionize pipelines and rollouts with reliability.
 * Monitor & improve: drift, calibration/uncertainty, and fairness (Independence/Separation/Sufficiency).
 * Translate research into pragmatic wins for our platform.
 * Partner with stakeholders: clear visuals, crisp narratives, and method presentation for analysts, clinicians, and executives.
   
   

Requirements


 * Passionate about AI's potential in healthcare; outcomes-oriented with a focus on impact, not just research.
 * Statistics: parametric and non-parametric tests, hypothesis testing, experimental design, confidence intervals, and causal inference basics.
 * ML fluency: Python, SQL; polars (or pandas), scikit-learn, XGBoost/LightGBM (PyTorch/transformers a plus); survival/time-to-event experience is great.
 * Visualization & storytelling: Expert at turning complex analyses into crisp user visualizations, dashboards, and narratives for clinicians and executives.
 * Customer-facing: Comfortable interviewing stakeholders, presenting to AI/data science leaders, and defending methods.
 * Read the latest research and rapidly translate new statistical/ML papers into pragmatic wins.
 * 3 - 5+ years of relevant experience from a high-growth environment.
 * BS/MS in Statistics, Biostats, CS, or equivalent experience.
 * Resourceful, fast learner, high ownership, bias to action, fast experimentation cycles, and ability to work independently while collaborating in a small team.
 * Understanding of fairness: Independence, Separation, and Sufficiency
   
   

Nice-to-Haves

 * Uncertainty quantification
 * Covariate and prediction drift detection in production
 * Hands-on experience with LLMs in production; LLMs for clinical text, weak/active/semi-supervised learning.
 * Strong software engineering skills with proven ML experience: Productionizing models (tabular/text data preferred; not pure vision specialists) and building scalable pipelines.

OpenAI’s Financial Engineering (FinEng) team powers how revenue flows through our products—pricing & packaging, checkout, payments, subscriptions, and the financial infrastructure behind them. We partner with Product, Engineering, Risk, Finance, and Go-to-Market to make paying for OpenAI products seamless, reliable, and efficient worldwide.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist on FinEng, you’ll own the analytics and experimentation that improve our checkout and payments, subscriptions, and pricing & monetization systems. You’ll define the metrics that matter, build the source-of-truth data assets, and design experiments that increase conversion, reduce churn and payment failures, and expand global payment method coverage. Your work will directly influence revenue, customer experience, and how we scale internationally.

This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In this role, you will


 * Own checkout & payments analytics and experimentation across methods and locales (e.g., bank transfers, emerging rails), improving conversion while monitoring risk and latency.
 * Build and run the experimentation program for in-house checkout—define success metrics and guardrails, execute staged rollouts, and use offline incrementality when online tests aren’t feasible.
 * Create operational visibility and source-of-truth data with FinEng Data Engineering—land team-level metrics, SLAs, and self-serve dashboards that drive proactive action.
 * Lead subscription, retention, and monetization analytics—ship launch-readiness for new subscription features, reduce involuntary churn (e.g., targeted retrials/nudges), and develop elasticity/FX frameworks toward pricing optimality.
   
   

You might thrive in this role if you have


 * 5+ years in a quantitative role (data science, product analytics, or experimentation) in high-growth or fintech environments
 * Fluency in SQL and Python, with a track record designing and interpreting A/B tests and quasi-experiments
 * Experience building product metrics from scratch and operationalizing them for decision-making
 * Excellent communication skills with PMs, engineers, risk/finance partners, and executives
 * Strategic instincts beyond significance tests—clear thinking about tradeoffs (conversion vs. risk vs. cost vs. user experience)
   
   

You could be an especially great fit if you have


 * Payments, checkout, or subscription analytics experience (PSPs, bank rails, disputes/refunds, risk, e-commerce)
 * Background in offline incrementality methods, uplift modeling, CUPED/causal inference, or counterfactual evaluation
 * Experience with internationalization/local payments, FX, and pricing & packaging strategy
 * Comfort building operational analytics (alerting, SLIs/SLOs) and partnering closely with data engineering

Inspira Education Group is one of the fastest-growing edtech startups in the US. We started with a simple mission to democratize access to high-quality coaching so that every student in the world has an equal opportunity to access the best opportunities.

As the world’s leading network of top admissions coaches in medical, legal, business, and college studies, we’re building software and services in one place—disrupting long-entrenched application processes with products and experiences that strive to provide an equal platform for candidates from diverse backgrounds worldwide.

As one of the fastest-growing edtech firms in the world, we are backed by some of the leading venture capital firms and investors in the world, including Zeev Ventures, Quiet Capital, Craft Ventures, Jeff Fluhr (Founder of Stubhub), and David Sacks (Former COO of PayPal and Founder of Yammer).

The Role

Inspira Education Group is searching for a Head of Online Events to build and scale one of the most powerful growth engines in our company. This is not a “run a few webinars” role—this is your chance to architect a category-defining events machine that shapes how tens of thousands of students and parents experience our brand.

You’ll own the entire ecosystem—from creative vision and content strategy to flawless production, promotion, measurement, and team building.

For the first 2–3 months, you’ll be in the cockpit yourself: hosting events, crafting decks, talking to consultants, learning our audience inside out, and building the operational backbone. Then you’ll shift into building a team and scaling the volume, sophistication, and impact of our events across multiple brands.

If you’re a rare hybrid—a strategist with creative instincts, a designer with operational rigor, and a marketer who lives and breathes KPIs—this is your playground. You’ll get to be scrappy at the start, then build a well-oiled machine that drives massive, measurable results.

What You'll Do

Strategy, Creativity & Content Development


 * Develop the full content calendar across all our verticals.
 * Brainstorm and test new formats (AMAs, bootcamps, “day in the life,” panel discussions, masterclasses).
 * Draft compelling hooks, angles, and narratives that maximize registrations and conversions.
 * Collaborate with Sales to develop follow-up strategies that drive consultations and revenue.
 * Develop high-impact script outlines, run-of-show docs, and creative briefs.
   
   

Production, Ops & Execution (Initially Hands-On)

 * Manage all GoToWebinar/Zoom technical logistics, troubleshooting, and QA.
 * Coordinate independently with consultants, tutors, and presenters to gather materials, prepare them, and ensure high-quality delivery.
 * Build all pre-event and post-event emails; collaborate with lifecycle team to improve automated flows.
 * Ensure strong UTM tracking, funnel measurement, and reliable data accuracy.
   
   

Growth & Demand Generation


 * Own event promotion strategy: landing pages, email copy, SMS, social media briefs, and paid support.
 * Experiment with hooks, creative assets, incentives, and timing to increase signups.
 * Drive KPI improvements across all key metrics such as registrations per event, cost per attendee, attendance rate, and revenue attributed.
   
   

Team Building & Management


 * Train high-performing moderators and junior presenters.
 * Know how to evaluate talent, give feedback, and—when necessary—make hard decisions about performance.
 * Build SOPs, templates, automation, and workflows to make events scalable.
   
   

AI, Design, & Systems Efficiency


 * Use AI tools to improve deck creation, clip editing, graphics, and copywriting workflows.
 * Maintain a strong aesthetic bar—able to distinguish excellent vs mediocre design and copy.
 * Work closely with the social team to repurpose webinar content into TikToks, Reels, YouTube clips.
 * Help research and test offline event opportunities if strategically valuable (e.g., college fairs, MCAT meetups).
   
   

Who You Are

Ideal Professional Background


 * 5–10 years experience in marketing, events, webinars, lifecycle, content, or growth.
 * Proven track record of scaling webinar programs or owned content engines.
 * Experience working in fast-paced growth environments.
 * Education/test-prep/admissions background is a plus but not required.
 * Experience with HubSpot and landing page builders is a bonus.
   
   

High Ownership


 * Comfortable being an IC for the first few months.
 * Aggressive mindset toward scaling volume while improving quality.
   
   

Creative + Analytical


 * Can generate fresh ideas for topics, hooks, and formats.
 * Numbers-driven: lives inside dashboards, funnels, and KPI targets.
 * Strong experimentation mindset (A/B tests across everything: timings, creatives, presenters).
   
   

Managerial Ability


 * Can hire, train, and manage talent.
 * Excellent collaborator across Sales, SEO, Social, Lifecycle, and Ops.
 * High emotional intelligence and strong communication skills.
   
   

Design & Aesthetic Judgment


 * Can recognize and demand high-quality visuals and user experiences.
 * Strong presentation-building ability; understands composition and flow.
   
   

Technical Fluency


 * Deep comfort with webinar platforms (GTW, Zoom, etc.), automations, UTM tracking, and event ops.
 * Ability to troubleshoot tech issues live under pressure.
   
   

AI-Native


 * Natural at using AI for design, copy, production, and operational efficiency.
   
   

Why you'll love Inspira


 * Amazing people with a great vision and values
 * Ability to work directly with co-founders and drive impact super quickly
 * Your work directly impacts the lives and careers of students across the globe
 * 100% coverage of health, vision, and dental benefits
 * Flexible Paid-time Off
 * Learning and Development Budget

""The AI startup growing faster than Canva""

That's what the Financial Review called us. In 18 months, we supported over 73 million patient visits and become one of the fastest-growing companies in the world.

Ee pivoted from broad healthcare AI to building Earth's finest AI Care Partner. Today, we support over 2 million patient sessions weekly across 116 countries and over 110 languages. Hundreds of thousands of clinicians use Heidi to complete documentation.

Our mission is simple: strengthen the human connection at the heart of healthcare.

We've found product-market fit with individual clinicians through our freemium medical scribe, transforming unstructured clinical visits into structured text artefacts. Clinicians and organizations quite like it. Now, we embark upon consuming more than just documentation. Every new job a clinician delegates to Heidi makes patients feel more attended to, cleans up health system logjams, and lets clinicians be clinicians again.

That's where you come in.

The role

We're looking for a Product Manager with founder DNA - the kind of person who could start their own company tomorrow but would rather build something transformative with us.

You will own Heidi's clinical knowledge product area, growing an early-stage product into the tool clinicians trust for instant medical knowledge. You'll compete where established players exist but none have our distribution or workflow integration.

You will report into Product leadership and partner closely with engineering, design, and clinical teams to execute fast and win.

This role will be based in our San Francisco office.

We don't care about logos; the traditional insignia of competence. We'll evaluate senior well-credentialed candidates and young, hungry hopefuls alike.

What You'll Do


 * Own product strategy and roadmap for Heidi's clinical knowledge experience, setting clear goals and being held accountable to achieving them
 * Build the product that becomes clinicians' trusted source for medical knowledge, shipping with bias towards action rather than waiting for perfect data
 * Obsess over clinician workflows to understand not just what they say they want, but what would actually transform their day when they need instant medical answers
 * Navigate regulatory and commercial complexity to build clinical decision support that's auditable, region-aware, and commercially viable
 * Become the subject matter expert who understands medical knowledge retrieval, citation systems, and how clinicians actually search for answers during patient care
 * Ship meaningful features by working closely with engineering, design, data and operations to launch them
   
   

If we'd worked together the last 6 weeks, you'd have:


 * Completed a listening tour across Heidi's products, understanding our current documentation capabilities and where the biggest opportunities lie
 * Spent a full day shadowing clinicians at one of our partner health systems
 * Shipped an experiment that challenged a core assumption about how clinicians search for medical knowledge
 * Written a product brief that engineering actually got excited about (rare, but it happens)
 * Jumped into customer support tickets to understand why clinicians were struggling with a specific workflow
   
   

What You'll Need


 * Track record launching 0-to-1 products that achieved meaningful traction, though we care more about what you've built than years on the clock
 * Founder or could-be-founder archetype. You work ON the business with bias towards action.
 * A romantic streak about software. You believe great design transforms someone's day.
 * Ability to see bottlenecks others miss and opportunities where others see constraints.
 * Strong opinions, weakly held. You'll shift the room when you're right.
 * Data fluency with SQL and comfort making decisions with imperfect information.
 * Technical literacy to engage on knowledge retrieval systems without getting lost.
   
   

If you answer 'NO' to these questions, this may not be the job for you:


 * Have you built 0-to-1 products or attempted founding?Are you an execution powerhouse?
 * Have you shipped consumer products at serious scale where small quality issues affect thousands of users?
 * Are you able to execute without a legion of data analysts, product marketers, and research coordinators at your beck and call?
 * Does the prospect of re-energising our health systems make you feel fuzzy inside?
   
   

Why Heidi?

Our health systems hurt everybody. Systems are log-jammed, clinicians' lives degrade in quality, and patients churn through the meat-grinder.

This is neither a special nor interesting insight.

However, it means we're solving a real problem. Hundreds of thousands of clinicians use Heidi. Every clinician using Heidi gets hours back in their day. This is the starting point to build the product of your dreams: immense distribution, and a world of potential.

You'll join a team that doesn't celebrate fundraise milestones, imaginary valuations, and glossy PR. We live and breathe the pain of modern health systems, and won't rest until we've exacted the change we'd like to see. We're medicos, engineers, and designers who've felt (on every side of the equation) what non-care feels like - the moral and practical toll as a provider or receiver.

The badews is it's not an easy job - you will tear your hair out more than once. Modern technology company concepts don't transpose unto healthcare easily. The lows are really low.

The good news is you will trust and admire everybody you work with, and rest easy knowing you're doing THE defining work of your career. The highs are blindingly high.

Heidi will take care of you. We offer healthcare/dental/vision benefits, 401k with 3% company match, a $500 annual development budget, and serious equity.

True A-players progress extremely fast here. The nature of the scale-up game is demanding, but we don't track hours or micromanage - you're trusted to perform. We value mental health and adapt to your schedule. We operate on outcomes > inputs, not process theatre. We all take the bins out, metaphorically and literally.

If the role description has scared you off, it was meant to.

THE COMPANY




Lion Holdings Group, founded by serial entrepreneur, investor and best-selling business author Patrick Bet David, is headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. We are not just a mere Holdco; we are “Architects of Enterprise Value.” Think of us as the force multiplier behind our market-leading companies. We don't just create companies or inject capital; we set vision, optimize strategy, install systems to focus growth, mentor leadership, and unlock value at every step in the process.




The Holdco stands as a strategic nucleus, a powerful parent entity designed not to manage day-to-day minutiae, but to own, empower, and amplify a curated portfolio of high-potential assets in three sectors: Media, Technology and Consulting.




Our Mission is to Enlighten, Entertain and Empower current and future leaders around the world and to deliver on that Mission we are irrevocably driven by four core values: Capitalism, Leadership, Debate and Entrepreneurship.




We select the companies in our portfolio based on a single question, “Does it Enlighten, Entertain and Empower?” Our companies form a powerful flywheel that generates business momentum from and for each other. Lion Holdings portfolio companies support and drive each other in two specific ways:



 * Momentum: One Company’s customer is another’s opportunity or lead.
 * Synthesis: Products and services are complimentary to each other, offering additional benefits to common clients.




At the top of the stack, Lion Holdings Group is an individual entity of its own. The organization contains functional leadership in finance, accounting, legal, HR, and IT who deliver these functions as “shared services” to the portfolio companies who are led by individual GMs directing their respective product, marketing, sales and ops teams. 




This strategic configuration ensures shared services (common functions) are not duplicated across portfolio companies, allowing those companies to focus on driving their business by focusing on product, marketing, sales, and operations.

Inspira Education Group is one of the fastest-growing edtech startups in the US. We started with a simple mission to democratize access to high-quality coaching so that every student in the world has an equal opportunity to access the best opportunities.

As the world’s leading network of top admissions coaches in medical, legal, business, and college studies, we’re building software and services in one place—disrupting long-entrenched application processes with products and experiences that strive to provide an equal platform for candidates from diverse backgrounds worldwide.

As one of the fastest-growing edtech firms in the world, we are backed by some of the leading venture capital firms and investors in the world, including Zeev Ventures, Quiet Capital, Craft Ventures, Jeff Fluhr (Founder of Stubhub), and David Sacks (Former COO of PayPal and Founder of Yammer).

The Role

Inspira Education Group is searching for a Head of Online Events to build and scale one of the most powerful growth engines in our company. This is not a “run a few webinars” role—this is your chance to architect a category-defining events machine that shapes how tens of thousands of students and parents experience our brand.

You’ll own the entire ecosystem—from creative vision and content strategy to flawless production, promotion, measurement, and team building.

For the first 2–3 months, you’ll be in the cockpit yourself: hosting events, crafting decks, talking to consultants, learning our audience inside out, and building the operational backbone. Then you’ll shift into building a team and scaling the volume, sophistication, and impact of our events across multiple brands.

If you’re a rare hybrid—a strategist with creative instincts, a designer with operational rigor, and a marketer who lives and breathes KPIs—this is your playground. You’ll get to be scrappy at the start, then build a well-oiled machine that drives massive, measurable results.

About The Role

    * A semantic enrichment and transformation engine, leveraging LLMs and tool-use to reason about and contextualize data.
    * A query engine that enables low-latency filtering and aggregation of enriched entities.
    * A workflow orchestration layer that lets users trigger actions in tools like Slack, Outreach, and CRMs via APIs or webhooks.

 * Prototype, iterate, and ship quickly: You'll have deep autonomy to test ideas, own systems, and ship features that impact customers directly.
 * Prioritize security and reliability: Handle sensitive customer data with best-in-class security practices and a strong foundation of reliability.
 * Elevate the engineering bar: We value clean abstractions, fast feedback loops, thoughtful testing, and excellent developer tooling.
   
   

What you bring

We’re still early and moving fast—ideal teammates thrive with autonomy, ambiguity, and high impact. You might be a fit if you:


 * Have 3+ years of experience building production-ready distributed systems and 1+ years of experience with production grade AI applications
 * Have worked with data-rich systems and are comfortable reasoning across messy and fragmented datasets
 * Are excited by LLMs, tool-use, and applied reasoning, and have built or experimented with intelligent agent workflows
 * Have a strong bias for action, and enjoy collaborating in small, nimble teams
 * Think in systems, debug across stacks, and don’t hesitate to dive deep when needed
 * Hold a high bar for simplicity, reliability, and product-minded engineering
 * Regularly use tools like Copilot, Cursor, GPTs, etc. to boost productivity and explore new ideas

Siena is the first intelligence layer for customer experience. We're creating an operating system of AI agents that learn, remember, and act across every customer touchpoint—from support conversations to shopping experiences to voice and social media interactions.

Siena doesn't just automate support; it powers shopping agents, builds persistent customer memory, generates actionable business insights, and creates empathetic interactions that feel human.

We're transforming how businesses understand and connect with their customers, turning every interaction into intelligence that makes the next one better.

The team

We're a small, distributed team that punches way above our weight. Every person here has outsized impact because we've built leverage into everything we do. This philosophy makes us faster and, frankly, more fun to work with.

If you're excited about building something that doesn't exist yet, keep reading. We're building agents that don't just respond to customers—they remember them, learn from every interaction, and connect experiences across channels.

About The Role

As an AI Strategist, you're the connective tissue between traditional CX operations and AI-first transformation. You work with senior customer stakeholders to build strategies that integrate AI in ways that drive real, measurable results - not just automate for automation's sake.

You'll deliver a wide range of services across the customer lifecycle: partnering with senior customer stakeholders on strategic planning, leading hands-on workshops, conducting automation audits, delivering training programs (both virtual and in-person), and ensuring ongoing automations perform as promised. You're equally comfortable owning long-term customer relationships and jumping into new accounts to solve specific high-priority challenges.

This role is part of our Professional Services team. You understand how great CX organizations operate, and you help them evolve those operations for an AI-native world. You consult on strategy while rolling up your sleeves to execute - designing roadmaps one day, teaching teams to build automations the next, conducting audits to unlock the next phase of value throughout.

You're the bridge between what Siena's platform can do and what customers need it to do. Your deep CX expertise helps you spot opportunities others miss, and your ability to execute across multiple service offerings makes you invaluable to both customers and our internal teams.

What You’ll Do:

Partner with CX leaders on AI-first strategy


 * Work with VPs of CX, Directors of Customer Support, and Operations Leaders to design their AI transformation roadmap
 * Diagnose what's blocking progress (technical limitations, operational gaps, stakeholder alignment) and design solutions
 * Challenge assumptions about existing processes—help leaders reimagine workflows for an AI-first world, not just automate broken ones
 * Balance quick wins with strategic long-term initiatives that fundamentally transform how their teams operate
 * Own relationships with key accounts where ongoing strategic partnership drives the most value
 * Triage technical issues and keep support and engineering teams accountable for resolution
   
   

Deliver high-impact services across the customer journey


 * Lead Automation Workshops where you collaboratively design and build automations with customer teams
 * Deliver engaging AI Manager Training sessions (virtual and in-person) that build customer confidence and product fluency
 * Conduct automation audits on live customer environments to identify optimization opportunities and expansion potential
 * Perform systematic QA on automations, reviewing conversation data to verify performance and identify improvements
 * Jump into accounts you don't know well to solve specific focus areas—a new channel launch, a stalled automation program, a critical optimization need
   
   

Drive strategic outcomes through CX expertise


 * Identify high-value automation opportunities based on deep understanding of CX operations and business impact
 * Think several steps ahead: understand customer goals, diagnose blockers, prioritize by business impact
 * Own measurable outcomes (CSAT improvement, cost reduction, automation rate growth) not just task completion
 * Be proactive: spot issues before customers do, identify expansion opportunities, keep accounts healthy
 * Balance being consultative and strategic with being hands-on and tactical depending on what the customer needs
   
   

Enable customer self-sufficiency and continuous improvement


 * Teach customers to think in AI-first terms and build capabilities themselves rather than depending on us
 * Create ""aha moments"" where CX leaders and their teams see possibilities they didn't know existed
 * Provide actionable feedback reports with recommended optimizations based on QA insights and strategic analysis
 * Build customer confidence and capability, not dependency
   
   

Collaborate Across Functions To Amplify Impact


 * Work with other Professional Services team members and the broader CX organization to understand and communicate the big picture of customer needs and blockers
 * Translate customer insights and patterns into clear, actionable feedback that helps Product and Engineering teams improve Siena
 * Communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and business context to technical teams
 * Help scale our service offerings by identifying patterns that should become repeatable frameworks or product features
 * Share knowledge and help teammates grow their strategic and technical capabilities
   
   

Own your work and drive results


 * Balance being responsive to urgent requests with proactive strategic work
 * Navigate ambiguity and make judgment calls about priorities and tradeoffs
 * Have difficult conversations when needed—push back on low-impact requests, challenge broken processes
 * Take ownership of customer outcomes, not just your individual tasks
   
   

Who You are

CX operations expert with strategic judgment


 * 5+ years in customer experience operations, preferably in e-commerce or omnichannel support
 * Deep understanding of CX workflows, pain points, metrics, tools, and what makes teams successful
 * Experience with enterprise CX platforms (Zendesk, Gorgias, Kustomer, or similar)
 * You've lived the problems customers are trying to solve—you know what ""good"" looks like
 * You can diagnose whether problems are technical, operational, or stakeholder-related and prioritize accordingly
 * Comfortable advising CX leaders on organizational design, process optimization, and transformation strategy
   
   

Versatile Professional Delivering Across multiple service types


 * Comfortable leading training sessions, running workshops, conducting audits, performing QA work, and consulting on strategy
 * Can switch between hands-on tactical work and strategic thinking depending on what the customer needs
 * Systematic thinker who can design processes for repeatable service delivery
 * Comfortable with high-volume work (10-15 customer sessions per week) while maintaining quality
 * Able to own long-term customer relationships and build trust at multiple levels of the organization
   
   

Engaging facilitator and teacher


 * Can lead compelling live sessions (training, workshops, audit presentations, strategy sessions) that keep people engaged
 * Comfortable presenting virtually and in-person to groups ranging from practitioners to executive stakeholders
 * Ability to make scripted content feel personalized and adapt on the fly to customer questions
 * Balance being empathetic and supportive with being direct about what needs to change
 * Build customer confidence and capability, not dependency
   
   

AI-fluent and technically capable


 * Excited about AI's potential to transform customer experience

 * Don't need to write production code, but understand how technical systems work well enough to collaborate with engineers
 * Experience with low-code automation tools, AI platforms, or similar technologies
 * Can translate between business needs and technical requirements
   
   

Proactive and outcome-focused


 * Bias toward action - you solve problems and keep things moving
 * Think ahead: anticipate customer needs, identify risks early, spot expansion opportunities
 * Focus on business impact and measurable results, not just completing tasks
 * Comfortable having difficult conversations and challenging customers when needed
 * Take ownership without waiting to be asked
   
   

Collaborative and adaptable

Our values

The people who thrive here are curious, customer-obsessed, and take ownership without being asked. They fix problems first and explain later. They're direct about feedback—both giving and receiving it—because they care more about getting things right than being polite.

They maintain high standards while moving at startup speed, and they build real relationships with teammates because they know that's how great work gets done. When things get tough, they adapt and keep pushing forward.

Our approach to AI

The people who thrive here treat AI like a natural extension of themselves. They've built their own ecosystem of agents - some for research, others for debugging, writing, analysis, or writing code. They know which AI works best for what problem.

Everyone gets premium accounts (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity Pro, Cursor, Lovable) plus a quarterly budget for new tools. But the magic happens in how we share knowledge. Demo days where someone shows off a clever workflows. Slack threads about which model handles a specific use case better. Learning from each other's AI workflows.

At Siena, we’re not just looking for people who can do a job. We’re looking for people who want to break boundaries, create the future, and reshape industries. If that’s you, we look forward to your application.

Siena provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.

Basis is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.

The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.

The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.

To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.

About The Role

Research engineers support Basis’ mission by translating research ideas into correct, robust, and scalable high-quality code.

We seek individuals who excel technically and value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research engineers aspire to conduct rigorous, high-quality, robust science, unafraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas to achieve this.

Basis is a collaborative endeavor, both internally and with our external partners; we seek individuals who relish working with others on challenges larger than those they can tackle alone.

 * Probabilistic programming and statistical inference
 * Deep learning
 * Causal inference
 * Program synthesis and analysis
 * ML Ops and systems engineering
   
   

These areas are honed within the context of building reasoning systems. Consequently, research engineers will also engage with topics such as programming language design and implementation, automatic differentiation, and SAT/SMT solvers, among others.

We expect you to:


 * Possess excellent programming and software engineering skills, especially in Julia, Python, C++, ML-family languages.
 * Have demonstrated the ability to drive software projects from start to finish. This could be evidenced by open-source projects, technical reports, and publications.
 * Be comfortable digesting research from PL and/or ML venues, such as PLDI, POPL, NeurIPS, or ICML.
 * Progress with a high degree of autonomy and under uncertainty.
 * Be enthusiastic about solving real-world problems and making a positive societal impact.
 * Have demonstrated significant technical achievements within ML engineering. Examples include:
    * You've implemented variants of newly published techniques from scratch.
    * You built systems and workflows for training large models distributed across many machines.
    * You've built systems that span all levels of the programming stack from high-level API infrastructure to close-to-the-metal code.
      

In addition, the following would be an advantage:


 * A PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
   
   

Responsibilities:

Position Overview:

Cynosure Wealth Advisors is seeking a high-impact Senior Associate/Vice President to join our team serving the Ultra-High-Net-Worth (UHNW) segment.

 * Manage liquidity: Perform liquidity risk identification and modeling, including forecasting for private fund capital calls.

 

Multi-Stakeholder Project Ownership

 * Drive execution: Run complex, multi-step client projects end-to-end.
 * Manage the ecosystem: Ensure clarity and accountability across external advisors (CPAs, estate attorneys, custodians) and private fund sponsors.
 * Track everything: Maintain precise tracking of action items and dependencies within our workflow systems (e.g., monday.com).

 

Operational Oversight & Quality Control

 * Lead the team: Act as a supervisor and multiplier for the Client Service Associate (CSA) team.
 * Enforce standards: Provide QA/QC over junior team workflows, enforcing documentation hygiene and audit readiness.

 

Investment Implementation

 * Support the portfolio: Manage the logistics of investment strategy implementation, including private fund commitments and distribution mapping.
 * Due diligence: Gather and reconcile account data, private investment documents, and capital account statements.

 

Qualifications:

 * 4–8 years of progressively responsible experience in UHNW-adjacent environments (Big 4 / National Firm Private Client Services preferred).
 * Strong document literacy regarding complex trust mechanics (ILITs, SLATs, GRATs, GST) and high-level tax reasoning (K-1 flows, entity returns).
 * Highly proficient in all Microsoft Office products; ability to learn new technology systems quickly.
 * Ability and desire to operate with an ""Ownership Mindset""— anticipatory, take responsibility for outcomes, and know when to escalate risks.

 

Benefits:

Benefits include medical with an option for a flexible spending or health savings account, dental and vision, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability, 401(k) with up to 5% of compensation match, and other voluntary benefits options. Benefits are effective on the first day of the month immediately following your start date.

Mariana Minerals is a software-first, vertically integrated minerals company on a mission to supply the critical minerals powering modern energy, AI, and defense technologies.

We’re reimagining how minerals are sourced, refined, and optimized by combining deep industrial expertise with software, automation, and data-driven decision-making. Join us as we build the future of responsible mineral sourcing and supply.

The Opportunity

We’re looking for a Senior Data & Integrations Engineer to own the data platform that connects our industrial systems to ML models—building the semantic layer between process engineering and AI-driven operations.

This role goes beyond traditional ETL. You’ll design and build robust Python-based data pipelines and semantic models that translate real-world industrial processes into structured, meaningful data for our machine learning and software teams. Your work will directly enable reinforcement learning algorithms that control physical equipment—where data engineering meets real-world impact.

 * Develop semantic data models and analytics layers that bridge process engineering, ML model requirements, and business metrics.
 * Architect data systems that support both real-time operations and historical analysis, prioritizing semantic accuracy and data quality over massive scale.
 * Evolve our data platform as we scale from our first facility to multiple operations—defining the foundations of a modern, industrial data stack.
 * Partner with ML engineers and process experts to ensure data is clean, consistent, and fit for model training and inference.

Required

What You’ll Bring

 * Proven experience creating semantic layers and analytics models bridging technical and business contexts.
 * Strong software engineering fundamentals—version control, testing, documentation, and maintainable code.
 * Hands-on experience with modern data tools (Airflow/Dagster, dbt, data quality frameworks).
 * Clear communication and collaboration skills; ability to work with ML, software, and operations teams.
 * A structured yet creative problem-solving mindset and comfort with ambiguity.
   
   

Nice to Have


 * API integration experience (REST, OAuth, rate limiting, retries).
 * Familiarity with time-series or industrial data (PLCs, LIMS, SCADA).
 * Exposure to ML pipelines and real-time data processing.
 * Experience designing data systems in manufacturing, energy, or process industries.
   
   

Why This Role Matters

This isn’t a big-data problem—it’s a smart-data challenge. You’ll create the connective tissue between industrial operations and AI systems, turning complex process signals into meaningful data that drives real outcomes.

Your work will directly shape how AI optimizes mineral processing and define the foundation of Mariana’s data strategy as we grow.

Why Join Mariana Minerals


 * Build systems that bridge the physical and digital worlds.
 * Work alongside engineers, data scientists, and industrial experts solving hard problems that matter.
 * Join a culture that values Extreme Ownership, Engineering Out Requirements, then Automating, and Sharing Your Legos.

 * Optimize cost/perf on Databricks (cluster policies, sizing, Photon, AQE, partitioning, file sizing, skew mitigation, Z-ORDER/OPTIMIZE).
 * Enforce security and privacy (Unity Catalog permissions, row/column-level controls, PII masking/tokenization, secrets management).
 * Enable self-serve with standardized, well-documented datasets; collaborate with ML on feature pipelines and Feature Store.
 * Champion software excellence: Git-based workflows, code reviews, automated testing, CI/CD for data, and IaC.
 * Collaborate with product managers, designers, and other stakeholders to develop strategies and implement new products and features.
 * Stay current with the latest technologies to maintain competitiveness and technological leadership in the market.
 * Various engineering-related tasks which continue to progress the organization’s mission.
   
   

Requirements:


 * B.S. in Computer Science or equivalent experience.
 * 8+ years building and operating production data platforms; 4+ years deep, hands-on Databricks/Spark (PySpark + SQL).
 * Proven ownership of a production lakehouse (S3 + Delta Lake) with strict SLAs and compliance requirements.
 * Expertise with Delta Lake (MERGE/CDC, schema evolution, time travel, OPTIMIZE/Z-ORDER, VACUUM) and DLT, Workflows, Auto Loader; Feature Store experience in production.
 * Strong data modeling (dimensional, canonical), SCD Types 1/2, and handling slowly changing entities and schema drift.
 * Track record delivering trustworthy datasets with monitoring, alerting, lineage, and clear documentation; able to define and maintain metric layers consumed by product and business.

Overview:

The Project Manager will lead the complete migration of data from Google Workspace (GWS) to Microsoft 365 (M365). This involves a tenant migration for 10,000 to 20,000 users. The Project Manager works as a peer to Technical Architects. They can consult with Migration Subject Matter Experts. These experts handle system configuration and migration services.

After that, the project includes a pilot migration, hypercare, and transition phase across GWS workloads. The overall structure is System-V. However, the design, build, test, and release phases will use Agile methods. These methods emphasize continuous integration and delivery.

We’re the makers of Devin, the first AI software engineer. Cognition is building collaborative AI teammates that enable engineers to focus on more interesting problems and empower engineering teams to strive for more ambitious goals.

Our team is small and talent-dense. Among our founding team, we have world-class competitive programmers, former founders, and leaders from companies at the cutting edge of AI—including Scale AI, Cursor, Waymo, Tesla, Lunchclub, Modal, Google DeepMind, and Nuro.

Building Devin is just the first step—our hardest challenges still lie ahead. If you’re excited to solve some of the world’s biggest problems and build AI that can reason through real-world tasks, apply to join us.

About The Role

Cognition’s AI Enablement Engineers help teams adopt Devin and integrate agentic workflows into their day-to-day development.

This role is perfect for someone who has strong engineering fundamentals, enjoys working directly with customers, and finds deep satisfaction in teaching others and unlocking their potential—while also thinking systematically about how to scale those learnings to the next 100 teams.

 * Identify high-ROI workflows for Devin across engineering, QA, support, data, and product teams
 * Create enablement materials, best practices, and shared playbooks based on customer learnings
 * Work with leadership to scale AI Enablement into a repeatable and productized offering—through digital learning content, partner certifications, and scalable training models
 * Collaborate with Cognition Engagement Managers and Engineering teams to continuously refine onboarding and provide feedback on new features

 * Proven ability to communicate complex technical topics to diverse audiences
 * Strong customer-service orientation and ability to thrive in interactive, people-facing environments
 * Excellent verbal and written communication skills
 * Demonstrated ability to learn and adapt exceptionally fast

Job Description



We’re building intelligent, autonomous AI agents that can reason, plan, and act across real-world workflows. These agents go beyond chat — they take meaningful action, work across tools and systems, and operate in complex, high-stakes environments.



As our Product Manager for OEM Engineering, you’ll lead the definition and delivery of early use cases for agentic AI. You’ll turn cutting-edge agent capabilities — like long-term memory, tool use, and planning — into applied, valuable products.



You’ll be use-case–driven, but platform-aware — working closely with engineering and research to ensure what we build is feasible, scalable, and aligned with the underlying agent architecture.



Use Case Discovery & Validation



 * Identify and prioritize agent use cases with high ROI: operational automation, coordination agents, internal task delegation, etc.
 * Work with users and stakeholders to understand their workflows, challenges, and trust boundaries.
 * Prototype and iterate agent behaviors in production-like environments to validate fit and reliability.

Product Design & Execution



 * Define the agent experience — from delegation to monitoring to escalation — for real-world scenarios.
 * Translate use cases into clear product specs: user flows, system interactions, prompts, safety requirements, and interfaces.
 * Own the roadmap and ship iteratively: starting small, learning fast, scaling wisely.
 * Drive OEM partnerships and product strategy to integrate and scale AI agents within enterprise software ecosystems.

Cross-Functional Collaboration



 * Collaborate with engineering to align product needs with agent platform capabilities (planning, memory, tool orchestration, retries, etc.).
 * Partner with AI research to bring experimental features into real-world settings.
 * Ensure the platform supports the complexity of applied, multi-step, tool-using agents.

Strategy & Metrics



 * Define success metrics around outcomes — time saved, accuracy improved, failures recovered — not just clicks or sessions.
 * Build product foundations that allow for vertical reuse, system generalization, and long-term scalability.
   
   

Qualifications


 * 5+ years of product management or startup experience building technically complex, user-facing systems
 * Strong intuition for applied use cases — especially in automation, operations, or real-world workflows
 * Familiarity with agentic AI patterns and tooling (e.g., LLM agents, tool use, LangChain, OpenAI functions, memory systems)
 * Experience working closely with engineers and researchers on system-level product decisions
 * Strong communication, prioritization, and execution skills

Preferred Qualifications



 * Exposure to or interest in domains like logistics, field ops, manufacturing, or systems integration
 * Background in AI/ML infrastructure, developer platforms, robotics, or IIoT
 * Experience designing for human-in-the-loop or semi-autonomous systems
 * Hands-on experience with prototyping workflows or agents using modern frameworks (e.g. LangGraph, AutoGen)
   
   

Additional Information



What We’re Offering



 * Salary Range: $1750,000 to $200,000 total package.
 * Flexible paid time off, including sick and holiday
 * Medical, dental, & vision insurance
 * 401K with Company contribution
 * Flexible spending accounts
 * Life insurance and disability benefits
 * Tuition assistance
 * Community involvement and volunteering events

Our team is small and talent-dense. Among our founding team, we have world-class competitive programmers, former founders, and leaders from companies at the cutting edge of AI—including Scale AI, Cursor, Waymo, Tesla, Lunchclub, Modal, Google DeepMind, and Nuro.

Building Devin is just the first step—our hardest challenges still lie ahead. If you’re excited to solve some of the world’s biggest problems and build AI that can reason through real-world tasks, apply to join us.

About The Role

Cognition’s AI Enablement Engineers help teams adopt Devin and integrate agentic workflows into their day-to-day development.

This role is perfect for someone who has strong engineering fundamentals, enjoys working directly with customers, and finds deep satisfaction in teaching others and unlocking their potential—while also thinking systematically about how to scale those learnings to the next 100 teams.
