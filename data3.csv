The individual will also contribute to global and regional media events when necessary, as well as support, media train, and staff Nike spokespeople (designers, athletes, catalysts, collaborators, and etc.) where relevant. This role is part of the NA media relations team, an extension of the North America communications team.

Fractional AI builds bespoke gen AI software to transform businesses. We work with PE-backed businesses and Fortune 500 clients across industries.

Every C-suite in the country is trying to bridge the gap between AI in theory and AI in practice. We close this gap with a world-class engineering team that implements custom end-to-end AI solutions. We are building a rapidly growing business at the forefront of applied AI and work with some of the largest PE firms in the world.

This is a company for intellectually curious individuals looking to make an impact from day 1.

About The Role

In this role, you are responsible for growing and managing a book of business while building deep relationships across the industry. You will be both a deal closer and strategic AI value creation advisor, shaping how leading firms apply Gen AI to achieve measurable business outcomes.

This is a unique opportunity to join an early-stage company that is both just getting started and also has a repeatable GTM motion for something that solves a real customer pain.

This is a quota-carrying role.

What you’ll do:


 * Drive revenue: Lead the entire sales cycle end-to-end. Work with AI Architects to scope projects, lead C-suite workshops, and position Fractional AI as the obvious choice for complex applied AI work
 * Advise on AI strategy: Become a trusted AI consultant in your own right. This includes guiding executives towards the highest ROI implementation projects, as well as providing expertise on diligences and AI advisory projects
 * Account strategy and success: Develop and execute against strategic plans to grow key accounts. Oversee your portfolio of ongoing projects and provide direction
 * Be in the room: Secure invitations and represent the company at industry conferences as well as private events/summits
 * Build your network: Develop trust and deep relationships with investors and operators at the firm-level, and executives at portfolio companies
 * Travel: Up to 1-2 trips per month to client sites and PE firm offices
   
   

What you bring to the table:


 * 8-15 years combined experience in consulting, highly technical enterprise sales, and/or private equity.
 * Proven track record exceeding quotas in complex B2B deals
 * Executive presence and ability to engage credibly on technical concepts
 * Strategic networker with deep relationship-building skills
 * Bonus: Experience in AI, private equity, early stage start-ups, professional services
   
   

Snapshot of your first few months:


 * Ramping up by listening in on as many sales calls as possible and shadowing our Delivery team on ongoing projects
 * Starting to take over deals on your primary accounts
 * By the end of 90 days, you will be owning and building your own book of business
   
   

Why you should (and shouldn’t) join us

We believe in transparency and know joining a company is a big decision. We’re not the best fit for everyone and try to be clear on what we are and what we’re not so you make the choice that’s right for you.

Why join Fractional?


 * We are filling a massive gap in a massive market: Getting genAI into production is the challenge of our time – with legacy consulting firms already driving several billion dollars per year on genAI advising revenue. Most offerings on the market don’t meet the need – they are one size fits all product solutions or advising services without the engineering team to deliver. We offer the engineering talent to meet the need.
 * We have real momentum and demand: PE firms know our name and are calling us when they need help. Our revenue has already tripled year to date and our go-forward targets are incredibly ambitious and attainable at the same time.
 * A front-row seat to the AI revolution: The exposure and learnings that you will get around what is real in the world of AI and how enterprises are using this technology to improve their businesses will be unmatched. In a given week you will meet with 10+ different companies across industries with different use cases. And you will be leading the way to help them figure out how to bring their vision to life.
 * Become an expert: Your exposure to hundreds of AI projects and scoping them will give you a world-leading vantage point and expertise in the space
   
   

Why shouldn't you join Fractional?


 * We are unapologetically building an engineering-first culture. This is how we build the team to meet the moment. We overdeliver for our clients by crafting a culture that enables the best engineers to thrive.
 * We are a professional services business. You will have to spend some of your time with customers advising
 * We are in-person. We’re committed to building an in-person team in San Francisco. This enables us to learn faster together. For the right person, this is a pro, not a con, but it’s non-negotiable.
 * We meet our clients where they are. As in-person collaboration is non-negotiable internally, the same applies externally. We get far more done when we are in the same room. You should expect to travel about 1-2x a month.
   
   

Our Values

We overdeliver.

We overuse AI.

We “over engineer” the culture.

Location

We believe every American household deserves access to counsel in life’s biggest moments. At Finch, we’re building the infrastructure to make justice radically more accessible. Our modern approach to consumer law automates the admin work and puts clients first, starting with personal injury.

Since launching in April, we’ve grown 10x and are now powering pre-litigation for top law firms across the country. We combine expert operators with purpose-built AI to handle intake, claim opening, medical records, police reports, lien management, demands, and everything in between.

We’re backed by Sequoia, Redpoint, and the founders & CEOs of generational companies like DoorDash, Ironclad, and Digits. We’re rebuilding how the law serves everyday Americans from first principles, and we’re hiring exceptional operators to help us scale it nationwide.

This Role


 * Finch is building the operational engine that powers the best law firms in the country—and Strategy & Operations sits at the center of that mission. As part of this team, you'll work across multiple facets of our business to design the systems, workflows, and experiences that help firms run more efficiently, deliver better client outcomes, and scale with predictability.
 * This is a versatile role for someone who thrives at the intersection of process design, structured problem-solving, and cross-functional execution. You’ll dive deep into how work moves today, identify friction points, and craft high-leverage solutions that elevate the experience for firms, legal ops teams, and clients. Depending on your strengths and interests, your work may span case workflows, firm interfaces, legal ops experience, or broader operational scaling efforts.
 * You’ll blend analytical rigor with practical empathy—thinking holistically about the needs of attorneys, clients, and internal teams—while building systems that allow Finch to deliver fast, clear, high-quality outcomes as we grow.
   
   

You Will:


 * Analyze existing workflows and operational patterns to identify bottlenecks, gaps, and opportunities for improvement across multiple parts of the business.
 * Design scalable processes, playbooks, and standards that create clarity, improve consistency, and support predictable case outcomes.
 * Define interfaces and communication models that make collaboration seamless—whether with firms assigning work, clients awaiting updates, or internal teams executing tasks.
 * Partner with product and engineering to translate operational needs into tools, automations, and app experiences that support high-quality execution.
 * Develop metrics and visibility mechanisms that help teams understand performance, uncover operational risks, and measure progress.
 * Collaborate across Case Workflow, Law Firm Experience, and Legal Ops Experience depending on company priorities and your strengths.
 * Test, iterate, and refine operational systems as volumes grow, firm needs evolve, and new product capabilities come online.
 * Contribute to Finch’s evolving operating model, helping us scale efficiently without sacrificing the human-touch experience firms and clients depend on.
   
   

Your Team: Strategy & Operations

S&O at Finch is the tip of the spear: we identify the most important problems and opportunities for growth, and solve them fast. We own playbooks, workflows, and experiments that move the business forward. You’ll work cross-functionally with Legal Ops, Product & Engineering, and Growth to deliver 10x improvements for our attorney partners, their clients, and our internal teams. We value velocity, grit, ownership, and — above all — optimism.

You Might Be a Fit if You:


 * Have 3-5+ years in a problem-solving role (e.g., consulting, BizOps, Strategy, Tech)
 * Have experience building zero-to-one systems or teams
 * Love navigating ambiguity and operating with urgency
 * Can zoom out to define strategy and dive deep to execute

Sunset helps tech startups shut down. We’re the 1-stop shop for dissolutions, handling all the legal, tax, and operational burdens that go into winding down. We make sure founders and investors avoid penalties, reduce liabilities, and can immediately move on to what's next.

In 2 years, we’ve helped over 350+ venture-backed startups shut down, are generating millions in revenue, and raised $5.5M from some of the world’s best entrepreneurs and investors.

The Role

As a Full-Stack Engineer at Sunset, you’ll turn messy legal, tax, and operational workflows into simple, reliable software for founders at a difficult moment. You’ll run a thoughtful, no-drama build process—from discovery and scoping through delivery—using tight loops with operations, legal, and tax to ship the right thing quickly (even if that means saying no and cutting scope). You’ll own features end-to-end across frontend, backend, and integrations, and extend our newly launched, increasingly automated platform with high-leverage services. You’ll push practical AI where it truly helps, harden security and observability, and keep impeccable engineering hygiene (types, tests, reviews, monitoring). This role demands strong product instincts, clear communication, and adaptability in a fast-moving environment where things change quickly.

Why This Is Interesting


 * Real problems, real leverage: you’ll touch legal, tax, and financial workflows that usually take months of human effort.
 * High context: we’re in-person in Dumbo, shipping fast with tight loops between engineering, product, and ops.
 * Small team: early ownership, direct impact, no middle layers.
 * Mission: you’re helping founders close one chapter and start another
   
   

What You’ll Work On


 * Build and own features end-to-end across frontend, backend, and integrations.
 * Push the limits of how we can leverage AI in clever ways to speed everyone up and delight our customers.
 * Model legal and financial workflows into reliable, powerful automations.
 * Ship integrations with payroll, accounting, e-sign systems, and many more
 * Improve our internal tooling like client comms tool, metrics dashboards, and task management.
 * Keep raising the bar on code clarity, observability, and security.
   
   

Our Stack


 * Frontend: TypeScript, React Router, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Storybook
 * API: tRPC, React Query, Zod
 * Backend: Node, Prisma + PostgreSQL, Redis
 * Infra: Render & AWS
   
   

You Might Be a Fit If


 * You are a product minded engineer
 * AI tools like Cursor are deeply integrated into your dev workflow
 * You like moving quickly without waiting on designers from a designer or perfectly scoped PRDs
 * You’ve shipped products end to end, from tweaking CSS through to adding necessary DevOps
   
   

This role might not be a fit if:


 * You want to work remote or hybrid (we’re in-person 5 days/week in Brooklyn).
 * You don’t like scoping, designing, implementing your own feature work.
 * You prefer long planning cycles or narrow ownership.
 * You’re not interested in the mission of helping founders close well and move on.
   
   

Compensation & Benefits


 * Competitive salary + meaningful equity
 * 100% covered medical, dental, and vision
 * Unlimited PTO
 * $500 in-office setup allowance
   
   

How We Hire


 * Intro chat (20 min) – mutual fit and interests
 * Technical session (1hr) – collaborative problem-solving
 * Onsite (2–3 hrs) – product deep dive, system design, meet the team
 * Quick references → offer

About The Syracuse Area

Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues.

Description

Position Definition:

The Stress, Trauma, and Resilience Program (STaR Lab) at the San Francisco VA Health Care System (SFVAHCS), in partnership with Northern California Institute for Research and Education, Inc. (NCIRE) and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), is seeking an experienced Staff Research Associate II (SRA II) to support and help manage clinical and experimental studies on trauma- and stressor-related disorders in Veterans, with a particular focus on PTSD, sleep disturbance, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and fear learning.

Our overarching goal is to develop mechanism-informed, pharmacologically augmented psychotherapies that directly target the neural systems involved in these conditions, with a focus on enhancing fear extinction and related learning processes. Ultimately, we aim to translate this work into more targeted, effective treatments for Veterans with PTSD, insomnia, TBI, and other trauma-related difficulties.

This role is ideal for someone seeking a 50% research / 50% administrative position who has solid prior research experience and wants to play a central role in clinical trial coordination, psychophysiology data collection, and multi-site study operations. Highly motivated candidates may have opportunities to co-author publications and contribute to presentations.

This opportunity is open to full-time or part-time.

Essential Functions

Research (~50%)


 * Coordinate and support augmented psychotherapy trials that combine evidence-based PTSD treatments (e.g., exposure-based therapies) with medications that target mechanisms underlying the disorder, including those that facilitate fear extinction.
 * Administer, pilot, and analyze remote psychophysiological fear-conditioning paradigms, including online and lab-based experimental tasks.
 * Set up, monitor, and troubleshoot psychophysiological recording sessions using systems such as Biopac and Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)-based data pipelines.
 * Acquire, process, and organize multi-modal psychophysiological signals, including electrodermal activity (EDA), electromyography (EMG), heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), facial coding outputs, and remote photoplethysmography (PPG) signals derived from video.
 * Conduct and score clinical interviews and self-report measures assessing PTSD symptoms, trauma exposure, mood, and sleep-related functioning (training provided as needed).
 * Collect, process, and analyze sleep-related data, including actigraphy and EEG-based measures.
 * Assist with and increasingly take ownership of data management and analysis (e.g., REDCap, spreadsheets, data quality checks, and basic statistical software).
 * For candidates with appropriate clinical training, there may be opportunities to be involved in structured clinical assessment and to receive training in manualized, exposure-based psychotherapy protocols, delivering supervised, protocol-guided treatment components as part of the trial.
   
   

Administrative (~50%)


 * Coordinate day-to-day study operations, including participant recruitment, screening, scheduling, and follow-up, ensuring that visit windows and protocol requirements are met.
 * Maintain and organize regulatory documents (IRB submissions, amendments, renewals, consent forms) in collaboration with the PI and regulatory staff.
 * Serve as a key liaison with a multidisciplinary team of investigators, clinicians, coordinators, and collaborators across sites.
 * Track enrollment, timelines, and milestones; assist with and help prepare progress reports, RPPRs, and other grant-related documentation.
 * Support NCIRE and VA administrative processes, including onboarding of staff/volunteers, purchasing, and meeting organization (e.g., agendas, notes, action items).
   
   

Qualifications


 * Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, Neuroscience, Biology, Public Health, Social Work, or a related field; a Master’s degree or PhD is a plus. Individuals with clinical training, particularly in fields such as social work, clinical psychology, or counseling psychology, would also be a good fit, especially if they are interested in integrating clinical assessment and structured psychotherapy into research.
 * At least 2–3 years of experience in research or clinical trial settings, preferably involving mental health, neuroscience, or related clinical populations.
 * Strong organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to manage multiple tasks and deadlines.
 * Excellent written and verbal communication skills.
 * Demonstrated interest in trauma/PTSD, fear learning, psychophysiology, and/or sleep-related processes.
 * Experience with clinical trial management or coordination (e.g., tracking visit windows, managing protocols, interfacing with sponsors/regulatory teams) is strongly preferred.
 * Experience with psychophysiological data collection or analysis (e.g., Biopac, LSL, EDA, EMG, HR/HRV, facial coding, or remote PPG from video) is strongly preferred; enthusiasm for further developing these skills is essential.
 * Experience with data analysis or programming tools (e.g., MATLAB, Python, R) is highly desirable.
 * Clinical experience with trauma-exposed populations (e.g., Veterans, survivors of interpersonal violence, first responders) is highly beneficial for this role.
 * Comfort working with Veterans and individuals with trauma histories, with professionalism, empathy, and strong interpersonal skills.
   
   

VA Onboarding Requirements

NCIRE is an affiliate organization of the San Francisco VA Health Care System (SFVAHCS), which requires all candidates to complete SFVA onboarding in addition to NCIRE's onboarding process. The SFVA is a federal agency that requires a federal background check, occupational health clearance, vaccines and immunizations, and drug testing for certain positions. Drug testing may include screening for marijuana which remains an illegal substance according to federal law. The failure to pass required drug testing will disqualify candidates from employment.

The base wage range for this position is $25.24 - $40.60 per hour. The wage actually offered to a successful candidate will take into account various relevant and non-discriminatory business factors including, without limitation, the candidate’s geographic location, job-related experience, knowledge, and skills, and education, as well as internal equity considerations. A successful candidate may also be eligible to earn additional compensation including bonuses.

NCIRE is an Equal Opportunity Employer. This position requires access to United States Government research under the Veterans Administration. Per Veterans Administration regulations surrounding access to US research, qualified US Citizens will be selected over other individuals eligible to work in the United States. If you are eligible to work in the United States, you may still be considered for this position but only if no qualified US citizens apply.

We’re backed by Sequoia, Redpoint, and the founders & CEOs of generational companies like DoorDash, Ironclad, and Digits. We’re rebuilding how the law serves everyday Americans from first principles, and we’re hiring exceptional operators to help us scale it nationwide.

This Role


 * Law firms rely on Finch not just to execute work, but to serve as a seamless operational extension of their team. This role focuses on strengthening that partnership—ensuring firms always know where cases stand, can assign work effortlessly, and have the right insights to run their practice with greater predictability and scale. You’ll design the interfaces, communication loops, and collaboration models that make Finch feel deeply integrated into a firm’s daily operations.

 * Design operational “touchpoints” with firms including onboarding, periodic reviews, and feedback loops to ensure alignment and continuous improvement.
 * Introduce metrics and strategic insights that help firms understand performance trends, operational gaps, and opportunities to improve client outcomes.
 * Partner with product to shape tools and experiences that strengthen firm engagement and streamline how work flows into Finch.
 * Develop firm personas and segmentation models to tailor workflows, expectations, and communication styles for different types of practices.
 * Continuously iterate on how Finch integrates with firms so the partnership becomes smoother, more predictable, and more scalable over time.
   
   

Your Team: Strategy & Operations

S&O at Finch is the tip of the spear: we identify the most important problems and opportunities for growth, and solve them fast. We own playbooks, workflows, and experiments that move the business forward. You’ll work cross-functionally with Legal Ops, Product & Engineering, and Growth to deliver 10x improvements for our attorney partners, their clients, and our internal teams. We value velocity, grit, ownership, and — above all — optimism.

You Might Be a Fit if You:


 * Have 3-5+ years in a problem-solving role (e.g., consulting, BizOps, Strategy, Tech)
 * Have experience building zero-to-one systems or teams
 * Love navigating ambiguity and operating with urgency
 * Can zoom out to define strategy and dive deep to execute
 * Care deeply about client experience and operational excellence
   
   

Compensation

$100,000 - $180,000 annual salary + equity

Additional benefits include:


 * 100% coverage for health, dental, and vision
 * In-office snacks, drinks, and daily team dinners

Position Summary

This Engineering Innovation Leader supports the innovation pipeline – from problem discovery and ideation through evaluation, proof-of-concept, and hand-off into development. It combines strategic portfolio management with hands-on leadership of the innovation process, design-thinking workshops, rapid prototyping, and cross-functional collaboration to accelerate concept maturation and de-risk early-stage initiatives. The position requires strong analytical and storytelling skills to translate insights into ideas, influence evidence-based decisions, and align innovation efforts with overarching business strategy.

 * Accelerate concept creation and maturation: Lead design-thinking workshops and white-paper sprints, orchestrate rapid prototyping across engineering functions; drive to shorten cycles and de-risk early.
 * Ensure smooth integration to development: Define “definition-of-ready” for Pre-Development and PDP insertion, align requirements with Engineering for clean hand-offs.
 * Build and sustain an innovation culture: Run charrettes/challenges; codify fast-fail learning; align efforts with strategic themes to maximize business impact.
 * Partner externally and internally: Lead make/buy/partner analyses; engage suppliers and universities for feasibility accelerators and benchmarking; maintain strong ties across product and engineering teams
 * Measure what matters: Establish and track portfolio health and impact metrics (idea throughput, ARL cycle time, kill rate, number of charters, innovation vs. pre-dev investment mix, program stability/speed), and publish transparent, actionable readouts.
 * Support end-to-end innovation pipeline: Drive problem discovery, ideation, evaluation, proof-of-concept, and seamless hand-off into development to ensure disciplined progression from concept to execution.
 * Champion adherence to the innovation process: Model best practices and actively coach teams to follow established frameworks, reinforcing consistency and rigor across initiatives.
 * Mentor and develop innovation capabilities: Build organizational competency through coaching, training, and hands-on engagement, fostering a sustainable innovation ecosystem across Polaris Inc.

Epic Senior application analysts also spend time collaborating with cross-functional teams. Their day typically begins with a team huddle—either a weekly group meeting or a smaller session with their team lead or manager.
