I am working on an MBA research project focused on factors influencing expansion decisions of foreign investors in Kuwait.
My study examines three variables:

Government incentives

Ease of procedures

Market potential
And one outcome variable:

Expansion decision

I already have:

The full questionnaire

A draft research report

Clear methodology (quantitative, Likert scale, regression)

I am looking for a freelancer to help me with research-support tasks, including simulating a dataset, running the appropriate statistical tests, and helping me refine the analysis sections of the report.

This work is for learning, practice, and methodology testing — I take full responsibility for completing and submitting my own academic work.

Scope of Work 
1. Simulated Dataset Creation (60–80 Cases)

You will create a simulated dataset based on the questionnaire I provide.
The dataset must reflect realistic patterns that could appear among foreign investors operating in Kuwait.

Notes:

This is NOT real human data collection.

It is used to practice analysis methods and test the statistical model.

You may use AI, but you must review and adjust the data to ensure it looks realistic and varied.

Deliverable:

Clean Excel/Google Sheets file with all variables coded (1–5 Likert scale).

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Check for missing fields

Encode Likert-scale responses

Prepare dataset for statistical testing

3. Statistical Analysis (Required for My Methodology Practice)

Run the following analyses on the simulated dataset:

A. Descriptive statistics

Means

Standard deviations

Basic frequencies

B. Reliability testing (Cronbach’s alpha)

For each construct.

C. Correlation matrix
D. Multiple regression analysis

(Model: 3 IVs → 1 DV)

Deliver:

Coefficients, p-values, t-stats

R & R²

Interpretation of results

This is allowed because the data is simulated and the analysis is for educational and methodological purposes.

4. Research Report Support (Editing, Not Writing From Scratch)

This part must comply with Upwork policies.
The freelancer must NOT write academic assignments for me, but CAN:

Help improve clarity of the methodology section

Help reorganize missing sections (sampling frame, instrument development, limitations)

Help refine statistical results based on the analysis

Help rewrite unclear sentences in my existing text

Help me ensure consistency between questionnaire, variables, and analysis

Freelancer cannot:

Write the full report for me

Create original academic content intended for direct submission

Complete graded academic tasks on my behalf

They can:

Edit, guide, and refine my content

Provide analysis results

Suggest structure

Ensure technical accuracy of statistical interpretations

I will always be the one writing and submitting the final academic work.

✅ Deliverables

Simulated dataset (60–80 cases)

Full statistical analysis outputs

A well-structured analytical explanation of the results (for learning/reference)

Improved & clarified sections of my draft report (editing & refinement only)

Skills Required

Data Engineer Needed — Build & Sync a Level 1 Tick Database With NinjaTrader 8,BEL,Posted yesterday,2025-12-01T06:57:39.802Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/span-class-highlight-Data-span-Engineer-Needed-Build-amp-Sync-Level-Tick-Database-With-NinjaTrader_~021995386796994959223/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"Project Type: Fixed-price
Long-term work available after successful delivery
Application window: One week to apply, one week to select the ideal candidate

Before You Apply
I’ve had several freelancers promise they could deliver this exact project. Every one of them failed.
I had to request refunds repeatedly.

You might be thinking: if multiple engineers failed, maybe the scope is unclear—or maybe this client is impossible to satisfy. Those are fair concerns. I've asked myself the same questions. If you've built systems where a single misaligned broke, you know the consequences it has downstream.

Let me be direct.
I know exactly what the end result must look like, and I immediately recognize whether someone understands the problem or is improvising.

To avoid wasting your time and mine, the selection process is designed to filter out amateurs and highlight true experts.

If you require specific files, formats, schema samples, or reference data to evaluate whether you are suitable for this job, I will provide them as long as it is technically possible and within my reach.
I want you to make an informed assessment before committing, and I am willing to supply whatever is necessary to support that.

The Job
Build a clean, scalable, perfectly synchronized PostgreSQL tick database, fully aligned with NinjaTrader 8 historical and live data.
The system must also support adding NinjaTrader Market Replay files later if needed.

If the data is wrong, the strategy fails.
This is precision-critical work.

What You Will Build
1. Production-Ready PostgreSQL Time-Series Database

Tick schema
1 index for millisecond accuracy
High-performance architecture optimized for analytics

2. Automated ETL Pipeline for Portara Tick Files

batch-insert architecture
Deduplication and timestamp normalization
Ability to append new datasets without drift

3. NinjaTrader 8 Synchronization Layer

You will ensure alignment between:

Portara tick data
NinjaTrader 8 Market Replay data

You will build a synchronization validator that:

Compares tick sequences and timestamps
Generates a clear pass/fail sync report
Identifies divergence causes with precision

4. Fully Repeatable Pipeline

The system must support continuous ingestion without breaking structure, performance, or synchronization.

Who I Am Looking For

You are a match if you:

Have deep experience with data ingestion
Understand NinjaTrader 8’s data mechanics
Can build clean, scalable PostgreSQL systems
Care about precision, validation, and auditability
Communicate technical reasoning clearly
Deliver correct results the first time

If a 1-millisecond timestamp mismatch bothers you, this project will suit you.

Required Skills

PostgreSQL
Python
Tick-level modeling
ETL engineering
Ability to explain reasoning clearly
Understanding of NinjaTrader 8 is a strong advantage

What I Expect in Your Application (Non-Negotiable)

To avoid repeating past failures, your proposal must include:

1. A clear explanation of HOW you will execute the job

Not a generic offer.
Not a list of tools.
Not a recycled cover letter.

I need to see your reasoning and workflow:

Your A-to-Z plan
How you validate tick integrity
How you guarantee NinjaTrader parity
How you handle format discrepancies
How you design the schema
How you benchmark ingestion speed
How you maintain sync over time

You do not need to reveal proprietary techniques.
I simply want proof that you understand the terrain.

If you require sample data, replay files, screenshots, or structural examples to refine your plan, I will provide them when possible.

2. Estimated timeline and fixed-price bid

Time duration and price in this post is an indication, in the end you decide the price and timeline that reflects your expertise.

Why This Project Matters

This database becomes the single source of truth for my trading operations.
If the data is inaccurate, every downstream system fails.

This requires someone who treats the work as a mission:
calm, precise, structured, and fully accountable.

Compensation

Fixed-price contract
Performance bonus for flawless delivery
Guaranteed long-term work for the engineer who proves reliable

How to Apply

Include in your application:

A concise introduction
Your A-to-Z plan for achieving perfect sync
Your fixed-price bid and time duration
Your answers to the questions

I will review every proposal within the next week and contact selected candidates the week after.
Only applicants who clearly explain their methodology will be considered.",CDD,Data Engineering

We run a legal-information chatbot for domestic violence survivors and need a senior Google Cloud plus Python data engineer to build a secure, PII-aware data pipeline from raw text transcripts to anonymized text, then into BigQuery metrics, and finally a basic dashboard for grants.

This is primarily a data engineering and ETL role, with light analytics on top using BigQuery SQL and Looker Studio.

MUST-HAVE SKILLS (IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE)

Please only apply if you are strong in all of these:

1. Google Cloud Platform – BigQuery, GCS, IAM (senior level)
   - Designing and populating BigQuery tables for analytics
   - Loading data into BigQuery from Python
   - Designing GCS buckets, prefixes, lifecycle rules
   - Creating and using service accounts with least-privilege IAM

2. Python ETL and data pipelines (senior level)
   - Parsing semi-structured text files into structured records
   - Building small, reliable pipelines with logging, error handling, and configuration files
   - Comfortable working on a secure Mac environment (local scripts calling GCP)

3. PII detection and anonymization (strong experience)
   - Hands-on with Microsoft Presidio or similar tools
   - Combining regular expressions and NER to mask names, phone, email, addresses, case numbers, and similar data
   - Understands how to keep city, state, age and resource names while removing direct identifiers

4. LLM JSON extraction (Vertex AI preferred)
   - Calling an LLM from Python, ideally Vertex AI
   - Designing prompts that return strict JSON according to a known schema
   - Handling invalid JSON, retries, and logging failures safely

5. BigQuery SQL and basic BI (intermediate–senior)
   - Writing queries for monthly summaries and KPI tables
   - Understanding fact vs summary tables
   - Comfortable wiring BigQuery into a simple Looker Studio dashboard (we don’t need fancy design—just clear numbers and charts)

Nice-to-have:
- Looker Studio experience beyond basics
- Streamlit or Hex dashboards (for possible future phase)
- Work with sensitive domains (healthcare, legal, DV, mental health)

PROJECT OVERVIEW

We have:
- About 18 months of chatbot transcripts, roughly 500 conversations per month. Some conversations are very long, up to 100+ pages.
- A detailed technical spec (v1.1) describing the architecture.
- A 59-metric dictionary for what we want to extract.

You will implement a v1 pipeline:
- Secure Mac environment (Python + Presidio)
- -GCS buckets (raw, clean, metrics-json)
- -Vertex AI (one call per conversation)
- -BigQuery (conversations fact table + monthly_summary)
- -Looker Studio dashboard connected to those tables

The architecture is mostly defined, but we are open to your expert suggestions if they lower complexity, cost, or risk.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND DELIVERABLES

A. GCP Setup

- Create and configure GCS buckets, for example:
  - raw (raw .txt with PII, 90-day retention)
  - clean (anonymized conversations)
  - metrics-json (per-conversation metrics JSON)
- Create BigQuery dataset (for example, “statutefinder”) with:
  - conversations table (per conversation)
  - optional messages table (per message)
  - monthly_summary table or view
- Set up service accounts and IAM roles following least-privilege principles.

B. Script 1 – upload_to_gcs.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Upload local .txt transcript exports to path like:
  gs://raw-bucket/YYYYMMDD/filename.txt
- Log which files were uploaded and where.

C. Script 2 – anonymize_and_parse.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Read raw transcripts from GCS or local storage (pattern to be agreed).
- Split into individual conversations using the known delimiter line “CONVERSATION #” plus the header block.
- Parse and preserve header fields: ID, DATE, LOCATION, MODEL.
- Apply regular expressions and Presidio to redact PII in the conversation body:
  - survivor, abuser, and children names
  - phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, case/docket numbers, etc.
  - keep city, state, country, ages, and clearly “resource” organization names (courts, shelters)
- Write sanitized conversations back to the clean bucket as .txt or .json files.
- Nice-to-have: produce a CSV listing detected entities per conversation for human review.
- Important: reuse or extend our existing Presidio anonymizer from our GitHub organization (we will share the repo).

D. Script 3 – extract_metrics_to_bq.py

- Read anonymized conversations from clean bucket.
- Compute structural metrics such as message counts, word counts, abandoned conversations, etc.
- For each conversation, call Vertex AI once with an external prompt file to extract:
  - legal topics, abuse types, statutes mentioned
  - booleans such as protection order discussed, safety plan delivered, shelter guidance provided, emergency referral suggested
  - primary language
- Enforce valid JSON output and implement minimal retry with logging when the model returns malformed JSON.
- Write combined metrics JSON to metrics-json bucket.
- Load rows into BigQuery conversations table, including:
  - conversation_id, date/time, location fields, structural metrics, LLM metrics
  - batch_id, processed_at, metrics_prompt_version
- Ensure idempotency so the same conversation_id is not inserted twice.

E. Aggregations and Dashboard Hook

- Write BigQuery SQL to create or refresh monthly_summary from conversations.
- Optionally configure a scheduled query (for example, monthly).
- Help connect BigQuery to Looker Studio and build a simple v1 dashboard page:
  - headline metrics
  - topic breakdown
  - map by state
  Clarity matters more than design polish.

F. Documentation

- README.md with setup and run instructions for Scripts 1–3.
- SECURITY.md summarizing buckets, IAM, lifecycle rules, anonymization flow (high-level).
- METRICS_GUIDE.md explaining how stored/derived fields map to the 59-metric dictionary (we provide the sheet).
- requirements.txt listing Python dependencies (Presidio, Google Cloud client libraries, Vertex AI SDK, etc.).

CONSTRAINTS AND PRACTICAL NOTES

- Data volume: about 500 conversations per month; some conversations are very long.
- Budget: around 500 USD fixed price for this v1 scope.
- Timeline: target 3–4 weeks.
- The secure anonymization environment is a dedicated, encrypted Mac controlled by us.

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- We export a new text transcript batch on the Mac.
- We run your scripts or trigger the flow.
- New rows appear in conversations; monthly_summary is updated.
- The Looker Studio dashboard refreshes and shows the new month’s numbers.
- We do not re-run the LLM on older conversations.
- Raw PII only lives in the raw bucket and is auto-deleted after its retention period.

HOW TO APPLY

Start your proposal with the word “METRICS” so we know you read this.

In 4–6 short paragraphs, please answer:

1. GCP and BigQuery example – describe one project where you built a pipeline using GCS and BigQuery. What was your role, and what did the pipeline do?
2. PII and Presidio experience – have you used Microsoft Presidio or similar tools? In what context, and what kinds of PII did you anonymize?
3. LLM JSON extraction – describe one project where you called an LLM from Python and enforced strict JSON outputs. How did you handle invalid JSON or failures?
4. BigQuery and dashboards – briefly describe your experience preparing data for dashboards such as Looker Studio or similar tools.

If you do not have hands-on experience with GCP, Python ETL, PII anonymization, and LLM JSON extraction, this project is not a fit.",CDD,Data Engineering

Project type: Short-term consulting engagement (architecture & roadmap)
Duration: ~2 - 6 weeks (part-time, flexible)
Location: Remote

About the Project

We’re working with a rapidly growing automotive parts & vehicle recycling group that wants to stand up a modern, cost-efficient data & analytics platform.

They already have:

A central Postgres-based data lake (on-prem)

A consolidated Domo environment heavily used for reporting

A small but capable analytics team (lead + data engineer + data analyst, all contracted)

Existing proprietary dashboards, datasets, and analyses built around Domo 

Project Brief -

We now need an experienced data & analytics architect to guide us through defining the future-state architecture and designing a phased migration plan.

This is not a “do all the engineering work yourself” role. We’re looking for a senior consultant/architect who can shape the direction, pressure-test options, speak with vendors, and advise our team as we go.

What We Need Help With

You will partner with our team over ~2 weeks to:

Discovery & Current-State Assessment

Review the existing Domo environment (data sources, pipelines, admin model, cost structure)

Review the Postgres/on-prem “data lake” and surrounding data flows

Understand team capabilities, current pain points, and target use cases / maturity goals

Help us articulate success metrics for the future-state platform

Options Evaluation (End-to-End Architecture)

Identify required near-term and medium-term features and capabilities for:

Data ingestion / ELT

Data transformation / modeling

Cloud data warehouse / lakehouse

BI / analytics / self-service

Propose and compare 2–3 realistic architecture options (e.g. Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift vs others; dbt / ELT tooling; Tableau / Power BI / Looker / ThoughtSpot / etc.)

Do light cost modeling for each option: licenses, storage/compute, engineering/admin effort, support, etc.

Help us pressure-test vendor claims and talk directly with reps if needed (Domo, cloud DW, ELT, BI)

Future State & Roadmap

Recommend a target architecture and preferred stack aligned to the client’s goals, technical maturity, and budget ceiling (we need to demonstrate an annual run-rate under ~$100K for data & analytics ops over the next 3 years)

Outline a phased migration plan off the 3rd-party Domo setup:

High-level timeline

Key milestones

Risks & mitigations

Resource needs (internal vs external)

Provide a high-level roadmap for how the architecture can evolve with the business (e.g. data science, more advanced analytics, operational apps, etc.)

Expected Deliverables

We’re expecting polished but pragmatic consulting deliverables, such as:

Current-state assessment deck (what we have, what’s working, what’s not)

Options matrix comparing 2–3 target architectures (features, costs, risks, scoring)

Target architecture diagram + recommended stack (tools and how they fit together)

Annual operating expense estimate (base case + a couple of scaling scenarios)

Migration & roadmap deck with phases, milestones, resourcing, and key risks 

Project Brief - 

We’ll handle formatting/branding; we want your thinking, logic, and clarity.

Ideal Consultant Profile

We’re looking for someone who:

Has 5–10+ years of experience in data & analytics architecture, ideally with:

Cloud warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Synapse, etc.)

Transformation frameworks (e.g., dbt) and ELT/ETL tooling (Fivetran, Airbyte, custom pipelines)

Modern BI platforms (Domo, Tableau, Power BI, Looker, ThoughtSpot, etc.)

Has done this before: designed or re-designed a modern analytics stack for a mid-market or PE-backed company and/or led migration off Domo or a similar managed BI platform

Is comfortable working within a cost ceiling and can think in terms of TCO and OpEx, not just “cool tech”

Is confident talking to vendors / reps:

Asking pointed questions

Challenging pricing & architecture suggestions

Translating vendor speak into practical implications

Can communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders (CEO, Director of IT, Director of Business Transformation, etc.)

Is comfortable in an advisory / guide role:

You don’t need to write every line of code

You do need to help our team make good decisions, avoid dead ends, and keep the architecture coherent

Nice-to-haves:

Experience with automotive / manufacturing / multi-site operations or similar industries

Experience with PE-backed roll-up / buy-and-build environments

Background in both BI/reporting and data engineering (you can see both sides)

How We’ll Work Together

Timeline: Roughly 2 weeks from start, with a few structured workshops and async review

Format: Remote; mix of Zoom calls + async collaboration in docs/slides

Team: You’ll interact with the client’s leadership (CEO, IT, Integration/Transformation) and a small analytics team

What to Include in Your Proposal

Please include:

A short description of your relevant experience with:

Data & analytics architecture design

Domo and/or migrations off similar BI tools

Cost modeling / OpEx planning for data stacks

1–3 specific project examples where you:

Designed a modern analytics platform or migrated from one stack to another

Had to work within a clear budget constraint

Your proposed approach in 5–8 bullet points for the 2-week engagement

Your hourly rate and an estimated total hours for this scope

We’re looking for someone who can drop in, quickly understand the environment, challenge our assumptions, and leave us with a clear, defensible architecture and plan.

The data is currently in CSV form and has been merged from multiple sources such as clinical tables, wearable glucose, activity monitor, environmental exposure, ECG or HRV, and participant metadata.
Data cleaning, joining on person_id, handling encoded nulls, basic imputation, and standardization have already been done in Python.

Now I need an experienced person to turn this dataset into a proper supervised predictive disease diagnosis project using tools from the Hadoop ecosystem.

Tasks to be done
1. Define the prediction label
- From the available columns such as study_group, clinical measurements like HbA1c or glucose related fields, create a clear target variable. It can be binary such as diabetic vs non diabetic or multi class such as healthy, lifestyle controlled, medication controlled, insulin dependent.
- Document the logic clearly so that we can justify the label creation.
- Handle class imbalance if the data is skewed.

2. Prepare the final modeling dataset
- Start from the merged file that I will provide.
- Select relevant features and drop id or leakage columns.
- Make sure categorical columns such as clinical_site, study_group, recommended_split are encoded in a way that works with Hive or Spark or Mahout.
- Output a clean modeling ready dataset in CSV or Parquet.

3. Load into Hadoop or Hive
- Upload the final dataset to HDFS.
- Create a Hive table on top of it and verify schema and datatypes.
- This should match typical academic big data requirements.

4. Train multiple models, not just one
- Train 3 to 4 suitable models so that we can compare. For example Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Tree if using Spark ML, or equivalent classifiers in Mahout.
- Choose models that are practical to run on this kind of tabular medical or wearable data.
- Do basic hyperparameter tuning to reach reasonable accuracy or F1 score.

5. Evaluation and comparison
- Give accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
- Provide a confusion matrix for the best models.
- Short note on which features seem most useful is appreciated.

6. Step by step run instructions
- We are new to tools like Spark and Mahout. So please provide a clear step by step guide on how to run the scripts or commands.
- This should include how to place the file in HDFS, how to create the Hive table, how to run the model training script, and how to view the results.
- A short README is enough, but it should be detailed.

What I will provide
- The already cleaned and merged dataset as CSV.
- The current preprocessing notebook or script so that you can see how the columns were created.

Requirements for the freelancer
- Hands on experience with Hadoop ecosystem such as HDFS, Hive and either Spark ML or Mahout.
- Comfortable with real world health or wearable datasets where data can be messy and incomplete.
- Able to define a target from the data and not rely only on pre labelled public datasets.
- Able to explain the steps so that we can reproduce them in our lab environment.",CDD,SAS

Need an AI app making for snowflake ai data,United Kingdom,Posted 3 weeks ago,2025-11-13T21:32:39.104Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Need-app-making-for-snowflake-span-class-highlight-data-span_~021989084013075879960/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"Summary
We’re Lopay, a fast-growing UK fintech and payments platform helping thousands of small businesses save on card fees and get instant access to their money.

We’re looking for a senior data engineer / full-stack developer to build a Hightouch-style reverse ETL platform — a tool that connects our Snowflake data warehouse to external tools, allowing us to analyze, manipulate, and trigger marketing and product automation flows directly from our data.

Essentially, we want a replica of Hightouch.com (in simplified form) — designed for internal use by our growth and marketing teams.

⸻

What You’ll Build
• A secure, internal web app that connects to Snowflake and pulls schema/data dynamically
• User interface similar to Hightouch, with:
• Source/destination setup (e.g. Snowflake → HubSpot, Meta Ads, email tools, Slack, etc.)
• Simple visual flow builder for syncing segments, campaigns, and triggers
• Query builder or SQL editor for defining custom datasets and rules
• Integration layer for marketing destinations (HubSpot, Google Sheets, Meta, Segment, etc.)
• Audit logs, scheduling, and data sync history
• Role-based authentication (internal Lopay users only)

Experience with customer journey management is highly valued — we’d like the system to support building and automating customer flows for onboarding, engagement, and churn analysis across tools such as Intercom, SendGrid, Salesforce, and other marketing or CRM platforms.

⸻

Technical Requirements
• Expertise in Snowflake, SQL, and data modeling
• Experience with APIs, reverse ETL, or data sync platforms (e.g. Hightouch, Census, Airbyte)
• Proficient in Python, Node.js, or TypeScript for backend
• Frontend experience in React / Next.js (clean, functional UI)
• Familiarity with OAuth integrations, webhooks, and RESTful APIs
• Understanding of marketing automation (HubSpot, Meta Ads, Google Ads, etc.)

⸻

Nice to Have
• Prior work building ETL/ELT or data-pipeline tools
• Experience with serverless deployments (AWS Lambda / Vercel)
• Data warehouse performance optimization

⸻

Deliverables
• MVP with Snowflake as data source and at least 3 destination integrations
• Secure login & user management
• Visual data mapping UI
• Working trigger logic (e.g. “send to campaign when user meets condition”)
• Documentation + handover

⸻

Why Work With Lopay

You’ll be building the internal data brain of a high-growth fintech used daily by our growth, marketing, and operations teams to drive automation, insights, and campaign precision.

We move fast, fund our projects internally, and appreciate technical autonomy — we want someone who can architect the full system and iterate quickly toward a usable MVP.

How to Apply

Please include:
1. Examples of similar reverse ETL / data integration projects you’ve built
2. Your preferred tech stack for this build
3. A rough estimate of timeline and budget for MVP delivery",CDD,AI App Development

Data Engineer Needed — Build & Sync a Level 1 Tick Database With NinjaTrader 8,BEL,Posted yesterday,2025-12-01T06:57:39.802Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/span-class-highlight-Data-span-Engineer-Needed-Build-amp-Sync-Level-Tick-Database-With-NinjaTrader_~021995386796994959223/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"Project Type: Fixed-price
Long-term work available after successful delivery
Application window: One week to apply, one week to select the ideal candidate

Before You Apply
I’ve had several freelancers promise they could deliver this exact project. Every one of them failed.
I had to request refunds repeatedly.

You might be thinking: if multiple engineers failed, maybe the scope is unclear—or maybe this client is impossible to satisfy. Those are fair concerns. I've asked myself the same questions. If you've built systems where a single misaligned broke, you know the consequences it has downstream.

Let me be direct.
I know exactly what the end result must look like, and I immediately recognize whether someone understands the problem or is improvising.

To avoid wasting your time and mine, the selection process is designed to filter out amateurs and highlight true experts.

If you require specific files, formats, schema samples, or reference data to evaluate whether you are suitable for this job, I will provide them as long as it is technically possible and within my reach.
I want you to make an informed assessment before committing, and I am willing to supply whatever is necessary to support that.

The Job
Build a clean, scalable, perfectly synchronized PostgreSQL tick database, fully aligned with NinjaTrader 8 historical and live data.
The system must also support adding NinjaTrader Market Replay files later if needed.

If the data is wrong, the strategy fails.
This is precision-critical work.

What You Will Build
1. Production-Ready PostgreSQL Time-Series Database

Tick schema
1 index for millisecond accuracy
High-performance architecture optimized for analytics

2. Automated ETL Pipeline for Portara Tick Files

batch-insert architecture
Deduplication and timestamp normalization
Ability to append new datasets without drift

3. NinjaTrader 8 Synchronization Layer

You will ensure alignment between:

Portara tick data
NinjaTrader 8 Market Replay data

You will build a synchronization validator that:

Compares tick sequences and timestamps
Generates a clear pass/fail sync report
Identifies divergence causes with precision

4. Fully Repeatable Pipeline

The system must support continuous ingestion without breaking structure, performance, or synchronization.

Who I Am Looking For

You are a match if you:

Have deep experience with data ingestion
Understand NinjaTrader 8’s data mechanics
Can build clean, scalable PostgreSQL systems
Care about precision, validation, and auditability
Communicate technical reasoning clearly
Deliver correct results the first time

If a 1-millisecond timestamp mismatch bothers you, this project will suit you.

Required Skills

PostgreSQL
Python
Tick-level modeling
ETL engineering
Ability to explain reasoning clearly
Understanding of NinjaTrader 8 is a strong advantage

What I Expect in Your Application (Non-Negotiable)

To avoid repeating past failures, your proposal must include:

1. A clear explanation of HOW you will execute the job

Not a generic offer.
Not a list of tools.
Not a recycled cover letter.

I need to see your reasoning and workflow:

Your A-to-Z plan
How you validate tick integrity
How you guarantee NinjaTrader parity
How you handle format discrepancies
How you design the schema
How you benchmark ingestion speed
How you maintain sync over time

You do not need to reveal proprietary techniques.
I simply want proof that you understand the terrain.

If you require sample data, replay files, screenshots, or structural examples to refine your plan, I will provide them when possible.

2. Estimated timeline and fixed-price bid

Time duration and price in this post is an indication, in the end you decide the price and timeline that reflects your expertise.

Why This Project Matters

This database becomes the single source of truth for my trading operations.
If the data is inaccurate, every downstream system fails.

This requires someone who treats the work as a mission:
calm, precise, structured, and fully accountable.

Compensation

Fixed-price contract
Performance bonus for flawless delivery
Guaranteed long-term work for the engineer who proves reliable

How to Apply

Include in your application:

A concise introduction
Your A-to-Z plan for achieving perfect sync
Your fixed-price bid and time duration
Your answers to the questions

I will review every proposal within the next week and contact selected candidates the week after.
Only applicants who clearly explain their methodology will be considered.",CDD,Data Engineering

4. LLM JSON extraction (Vertex AI preferred)
   - Calling an LLM from Python, ideally Vertex AI
   - Designing prompts that return strict JSON according to a known schema
   - Handling invalid JSON, retries, and logging failures safely

5. BigQuery SQL and basic BI (intermediate–senior)
   - Writing queries for monthly summaries and KPI tables
   - Understanding fact vs summary tables
   - Comfortable wiring BigQuery into a simple Looker Studio dashboard (we don’t need fancy design—just clear numbers and charts)

Nice-to-have:
- Looker Studio experience beyond basics
- Streamlit or Hex dashboards (for possible future phase)
- Work with sensitive domains (healthcare, legal, DV, mental health)

PROJECT OVERVIEW

We have:
- About 18 months of chatbot transcripts, roughly 500 conversations per month. Some conversations are very long, up to 100+ pages.
- A detailed technical spec (v1.1) describing the architecture.
- A 59-metric dictionary for what we want to extract.

You will implement a v1 pipeline:
- Secure Mac environment (Python + Presidio)
- -GCS buckets (raw, clean, metrics-json)
- -Vertex AI (one call per conversation)
- -BigQuery (conversations fact table + monthly_summary)
- -Looker Studio dashboard connected to those tables

The architecture is mostly defined, but we are open to your expert suggestions if they lower complexity, cost, or risk.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND DELIVERABLES

A. GCP Setup

- Create and configure GCS buckets, for example:
  - raw (raw .txt with PII, 90-day retention)
  - clean (anonymized conversations)
  - metrics-json (per-conversation metrics JSON)
- Create BigQuery dataset (for example, “statutefinder”) with:
  - conversations table (per conversation)
  - optional messages table (per message)
  - monthly_summary table or view
- Set up service accounts and IAM roles following least-privilege principles.

B. Script 1 – upload_to_gcs.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Upload local .txt transcript exports to path like:
  gs://raw-bucket/YYYYMMDD/filename.txt
- Log which files were uploaded and where.

C. Script 2 – anonymize_and_parse.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Read raw transcripts from GCS or local storage (pattern to be agreed).
- Split into individual conversations using the known delimiter line “CONVERSATION #” plus the header block.
- Parse and preserve header fields: ID, DATE, LOCATION, MODEL.
- Apply regular expressions and Presidio to redact PII in the conversation body:
  - survivor, abuser, and children names
  - phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, case/docket numbers, etc.
  - keep city, state, country, ages, and clearly “resource” organization names (courts, shelters)
- Write sanitized conversations back to the clean bucket as .txt or .json files.
- Nice-to-have: produce a CSV listing detected entities per conversation for human review.
- Important: reuse or extend our existing Presidio anonymizer from our GitHub organization (we will share the repo).

D. Script 3 – extract_metrics_to_bq.py

- Read anonymized conversations from clean bucket.
- Compute structural metrics such as message counts, word counts, abandoned conversations, etc.
- For each conversation, call Vertex AI once with an external prompt file to extract:
  - legal topics, abuse types, statutes mentioned
  - booleans such as protection order discussed, safety plan delivered, shelter guidance provided, emergency referral suggested
  - primary language
- Enforce valid JSON output and implement minimal retry with logging when the model returns malformed JSON.
- Write combined metrics JSON to metrics-json bucket.
- Load rows into BigQuery conversations table, including:
  - conversation_id, date/time, location fields, structural metrics, LLM metrics
  - batch_id, processed_at, metrics_prompt_version
- Ensure idempotency so the same conversation_id is not inserted twice.

E. Aggregations and Dashboard Hook

- Write BigQuery SQL to create or refresh monthly_summary from conversations.
- Optionally configure a scheduled query (for example, monthly).
- Help connect BigQuery to Looker Studio and build a simple v1 dashboard page:
  - headline metrics
  - topic breakdown
  - map by state
  Clarity matters more than design polish.

F. Documentation

- README.md with setup and run instructions for Scripts 1–3.
- SECURITY.md summarizing buckets, IAM, lifecycle rules, anonymization flow (high-level).
- METRICS_GUIDE.md explaining how stored/derived fields map to the 59-metric dictionary (we provide the sheet).
- requirements.txt listing Python dependencies (Presidio, Google Cloud client libraries, Vertex AI SDK, etc.).

CONSTRAINTS AND PRACTICAL NOTES

- Data volume: about 500 conversations per month; some conversations are very long.
- Budget: around 500 USD fixed price for this v1 scope.
- Timeline: target 3–4 weeks.
- The secure anonymization environment is a dedicated, encrypted Mac controlled by us.

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- We export a new text transcript batch on the Mac.
- We run your scripts or trigger the flow.
- New rows appear in conversations; monthly_summary is updated.
- The Looker Studio dashboard refreshes and shows the new month’s numbers.
- We do not re-run the LLM on older conversations.
- Raw PII only lives in the raw bucket and is auto-deleted after its retention period.

HOW TO APPLY

Start your proposal with the word “METRICS” so we know you read this.

In 4–6 short paragraphs, please answer:

1. GCP and BigQuery example – describe one project where you built a pipeline using GCS and BigQuery. What was your role, and what did the pipeline do?
2. PII and Presidio experience – have you used Microsoft Presidio or similar tools? In what context, and what kinds of PII did you anonymize?
3. LLM JSON extraction – describe one project where you called an LLM from Python and enforced strict JSON outputs. How did you handle invalid JSON or failures?
4. BigQuery and dashboards – briefly describe your experience preparing data for dashboards such as Looker Studio or similar tools.

If you do not have hands-on experience with GCP, Python ETL, PII anonymization, and LLM JSON extraction, this project is not a fit.",CDD,Data Engineering

Project type: Short-term consulting engagement (architecture & roadmap)
Duration: ~2 - 6 weeks (part-time, flexible)
Location: Remote

About the Project

We’re working with a rapidly growing automotive parts & vehicle recycling group that wants to stand up a modern, cost-efficient data & analytics platform.

They already have:

A central Postgres-based data lake (on-prem)

A consolidated Domo environment heavily used for reporting

A small but capable analytics team (lead + data engineer + data analyst, all contracted)

Existing proprietary dashboards, datasets, and analyses built around Domo 

Project Brief -

We now need an experienced data & analytics architect to guide us through defining the future-state architecture and designing a phased migration plan.

This is not a “do all the engineering work yourself” role. We’re looking for a senior consultant/architect who can shape the direction, pressure-test options, speak with vendors, and advise our team as we go.

What We Need Help With

You will partner with our team over ~2 weeks to:

Discovery & Current-State Assessment

Review the existing Domo environment (data sources, pipelines, admin model, cost structure)

Review the Postgres/on-prem “data lake” and surrounding data flows

Understand team capabilities, current pain points, and target use cases / maturity goals

Help us articulate success metrics for the future-state platform

Options Evaluation (End-to-End Architecture)

Identify required near-term and medium-term features and capabilities for:

Data ingestion / ELT

Data transformation / modeling

Cloud data warehouse / lakehouse

BI / analytics / self-service

Propose and compare 2–3 realistic architecture options (e.g. Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift vs others; dbt / ELT tooling; Tableau / Power BI / Looker / ThoughtSpot / etc.)

Do light cost modeling for each option: licenses, storage/compute, engineering/admin effort, support, etc.

Help us pressure-test vendor claims and talk directly with reps if needed (Domo, cloud DW, ELT, BI)

Future State & Roadmap

Recommend a target architecture and preferred stack aligned to the client’s goals, technical maturity, and budget ceiling (we need to demonstrate an annual run-rate under ~$100K for data & analytics ops over the next 3 years)

Outline a phased migration plan off the 3rd-party Domo setup:

High-level timeline

Key milestones

Risks & mitigations

Resource needs (internal vs external)

Provide a high-level roadmap for how the architecture can evolve with the business (e.g. data science, more advanced analytics, operational apps, etc.)

Expected Deliverables

We’re expecting polished but pragmatic consulting deliverables, such as:

Current-state assessment deck (what we have, what’s working, what’s not)

Options matrix comparing 2–3 target architectures (features, costs, risks, scoring)

Target architecture diagram + recommended stack (tools and how they fit together)

Annual operating expense estimate (base case + a couple of scaling scenarios)

Migration & roadmap deck with phases, milestones, resourcing, and key risks 

Project Brief - 

We’ll handle formatting/branding; we want your thinking, logic, and clarity.

Ideal Consultant Profile

We’re looking for someone who:

Has 5–10+ years of experience in data & analytics architecture, ideally with:

Cloud warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Synapse, etc.)

Transformation frameworks (e.g., dbt) and ELT/ETL tooling (Fivetran, Airbyte, custom pipelines)

Modern BI platforms (Domo, Tableau, Power BI, Looker, ThoughtSpot, etc.)

Has done this before: designed or re-designed a modern analytics stack for a mid-market or PE-backed company and/or led migration off Domo or a similar managed BI platform

Is comfortable working within a cost ceiling and can think in terms of TCO and OpEx, not just “cool tech”

Is confident talking to vendors / reps:

Asking pointed questions

Challenging pricing & architecture suggestions

Translating vendor speak into practical implications

Can communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders (CEO, Director of IT, Director of Business Transformation, etc.)

Is comfortable in an advisory / guide role:

You don’t need to write every line of code

You do need to help our team make good decisions, avoid dead ends, and keep the architecture coherent

Nice-to-haves:

Experience with automotive / manufacturing / multi-site operations or similar industries

Experience with PE-backed roll-up / buy-and-build environments

Background in both BI/reporting and data engineering (you can see both sides)

How We’ll Work Together

Timeline: Roughly 2 weeks from start, with a few structured workshops and async review

Format: Remote; mix of Zoom calls + async collaboration in docs/slides

Team: You’ll interact with the client’s leadership (CEO, IT, Integration/Transformation) and a small analytics team

What to Include in Your Proposal

Please include:

A short description of your relevant experience with:

Data & analytics architecture design

Domo and/or migrations off similar BI tools

Cost modeling / OpEx planning for data stacks

1–3 specific project examples where you:

Designed a modern analytics platform or migrated from one stack to another

Had to work within a clear budget constraint

Your proposed approach in 5–8 bullet points for the 2-week engagement

Your hourly rate and an estimated total hours for this scope

We’re looking for someone who can drop in, quickly understand the environment, challenge our assumptions, and leave us with a clear, defensible architecture and plan.

The data is currently in CSV form and has been merged from multiple sources such as clinical tables, wearable glucose, activity monitor, environmental exposure, ECG or HRV, and participant metadata.
Data cleaning, joining on person_id, handling encoded nulls, basic imputation, and standardization have already been done in Python.

Now I need an experienced person to turn this dataset into a proper supervised predictive disease diagnosis project using tools from the Hadoop ecosystem.

Tasks to be done
1. Define the prediction label
- From the available columns such as study_group, clinical measurements like HbA1c or glucose related fields, create a clear target variable. It can be binary such as diabetic vs non diabetic or multi class such as healthy, lifestyle controlled, medication controlled, insulin dependent.
- Document the logic clearly so that we can justify the label creation.
- Handle class imbalance if the data is skewed.

2. Prepare the final modeling dataset
- Start from the merged file that I will provide.
- Select relevant features and drop id or leakage columns.
- Make sure categorical columns such as clinical_site, study_group, recommended_split are encoded in a way that works with Hive or Spark or Mahout.
- Output a clean modeling ready dataset in CSV or Parquet.

3. Load into Hadoop or Hive
- Upload the final dataset to HDFS.
- Create a Hive table on top of it and verify schema and datatypes.
- This should match typical academic big data requirements.

4. Train multiple models, not just one
- Train 3 to 4 suitable models so that we can compare. For example Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Tree if using Spark ML, or equivalent classifiers in Mahout.
- Choose models that are practical to run on this kind of tabular medical or wearable data.
- Do basic hyperparameter tuning to reach reasonable accuracy or F1 score.

5. Evaluation and comparison
- Give accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
- Provide a confusion matrix for the best models.
- Short note on which features seem most useful is appreciated.

6. Step by step run instructions
- We are new to tools like Spark and Mahout. So please provide a clear step by step guide on how to run the scripts or commands.
- This should include how to place the file in HDFS, how to create the Hive table, how to run the model training script, and how to view the results.
- A short README is enough, but it should be detailed.

What I will provide
- The already cleaned and merged dataset as CSV.
- The current preprocessing notebook or script so that you can see how the columns were created.

Requirements for the freelancer
- Hands on experience with Hadoop ecosystem such as HDFS, Hive and either Spark ML or Mahout.
- Comfortable with real world health or wearable datasets where data can be messy and incomplete.
- Able to define a target from the data and not rely only on pre labelled public datasets.
- Able to explain the steps so that we can reproduce them in our lab environment.",CDD,SAS

Need an AI app making for snowflake ai data,United Kingdom,Posted 3 weeks ago,2025-11-13T21:32:39.104Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Need-app-making-for-snowflake-span-class-highlight-data-span_~021989084013075879960/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"Summary
We’re Lopay, a fast-growing UK fintech and payments platform helping thousands of small businesses save on card fees and get instant access to their money.

We’re looking for a senior data engineer / full-stack developer to build a Hightouch-style reverse ETL platform — a tool that connects our Snowflake data warehouse to external tools, allowing us to analyze, manipulate, and trigger marketing and product automation flows directly from our data.

Essentially, we want a replica of Hightouch.com (in simplified form) — designed for internal use by our growth and marketing teams.

⸻

What You’ll Build
• A secure, internal web app that connects to Snowflake and pulls schema/data dynamically
• User interface similar to Hightouch, with:
• Source/destination setup (e.g. Snowflake → HubSpot, Meta Ads, email tools, Slack, etc.)
• Simple visual flow builder for syncing segments, campaigns, and triggers
• Query builder or SQL editor for defining custom datasets and rules
• Integration layer for marketing destinations (HubSpot, Google Sheets, Meta, Segment, etc.)
• Audit logs, scheduling, and data sync history
• Role-based authentication (internal Lopay users only)

Experience with customer journey management is highly valued — we’d like the system to support building and automating customer flows for onboarding, engagement, and churn analysis across tools such as Intercom, SendGrid, Salesforce, and other marketing or CRM platforms.

⸻

Technical Requirements
• Expertise in Snowflake, SQL, and data modeling
• Experience with APIs, reverse ETL, or data sync platforms (e.g. Hightouch, Census, Airbyte)
• Proficient in Python, Node.js, or TypeScript for backend
• Frontend experience in React / Next.js (clean, functional UI)
• Familiarity with OAuth integrations, webhooks, and RESTful APIs
• Understanding of marketing automation (HubSpot, Meta Ads, Google Ads, etc.)

⸻

Nice to Have
• Prior work building ETL/ELT or data-pipeline tools
• Experience with serverless deployments (AWS Lambda / Vercel)
• Data warehouse performance optimization

⸻

Deliverables
• MVP with Snowflake as data source and at least 3 destination integrations
• Secure login & user management
• Visual data mapping UI
• Working trigger logic (e.g. “send to campaign when user meets condition”)
• Documentation + handover

⸻

Why Work With Lopay

You’ll be building the internal data brain of a high-growth fintech used daily by our growth, marketing, and operations teams to drive automation, insights, and campaign precision.

We move fast, fund our projects internally, and appreciate technical autonomy — we want someone who can architect the full system and iterate quickly toward a usable MVP.

How to Apply

Please include:
1. Examples of similar reverse ETL / data integration projects you’ve built
2. Your preferred tech stack for this build
3. A rough estimate of timeline and budget for MVP delivery",CDD,AI App Development

Parse and extract structured content (tables and labeled fields) from machine-readable PDFs. Where necessary, implement OCR fallback for scanned pages and clearly flag any files that cannot be reliably parsed.
Produce well-documented, reproducible outputs (CSV/Parquet/SQL) with standardized column names, provenance (source filename & URL), and extraction logs (success/failure, parsing notes).
Implement error handling, deduplication, rate-limiting, and logging to ensure reliable large-scale runs.
Work with the PI to define and validate field mappings against a provided extraction specification.
Deliver documentation and reproducible scripts (preferably in Python, runnable on Linux or a university cluster).
 

Required qualifications

Strong Python programming skills and practical experience with PDF parsing libraries (e.g., pdfplumber, PyPDF2/pypdf, tabula-py, camelot), OCR tools (Tesseract).
Demonstrated experience building robust, large-scale extraction pipelines (parallelization, rate limiting, retries, logging).
Experience converting messy parsed outputs into clean, validated tabular formats; comfortable with regex and rule-based cleaning.
Attention to detail, good documentation practices (clear README, usage instructions), and familiarity with version control (Git).

Preferred

Familiarity with exporting outputs to SQL databases or cloud storage (S3) and working with dataframes (Pandas).

Logistics & deliverables

Deliver a reproducible codebase (Python scripts or a lightweight package), sample outputs for a validation subset, and an extraction log for the full corpus.

Data Engineer Needed — Build & Sync a Level 1 Tick Database With NinjaTrader 8,BEL,Posted yesterday,2025-12-01T06:57:39.802Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/span-class-highlight-Data-span-Engineer-Needed-Build-amp-Sync-Level-Tick-Database-With-NinjaTrader_~021995386796994959223/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"Project Type: Fixed-price
Long-term work available after successful delivery
Application window: One week to apply, one week to select the ideal candidate

Before You Apply
I’ve had several freelancers promise they could deliver this exact project. Every one of them failed.
I had to request refunds repeatedly.

You might be thinking: if multiple engineers failed, maybe the scope is unclear—or maybe this client is impossible to satisfy. Those are fair concerns. I've asked myself the same questions. If you've built systems where a single misaligned broke, you know the consequences it has downstream.

Let me be direct.
I know exactly what the end result must look like, and I immediately recognize whether someone understands the problem or is improvising.

To avoid wasting your time and mine, the selection process is designed to filter out amateurs and highlight true experts.

If you require specific files, formats, schema samples, or reference data to evaluate whether you are suitable for this job, I will provide them as long as it is technically possible and within my reach.
I want you to make an informed assessment before committing, and I am willing to supply whatever is necessary to support that.

The Job
Build a clean, scalable, perfectly synchronized PostgreSQL tick database, fully aligned with NinjaTrader 8 historical and live data.
The system must also support adding NinjaTrader Market Replay files later if needed.

If the data is wrong, the strategy fails.
This is precision-critical work.

What You Will Build
1. Production-Ready PostgreSQL Time-Series Database

Tick schema
1 index for millisecond accuracy
High-performance architecture optimized for analytics

2. Automated ETL Pipeline for Portara Tick Files

batch-insert architecture
Deduplication and timestamp normalization
Ability to append new datasets without drift

3. NinjaTrader 8 Synchronization Layer

You will ensure alignment between:

Portara tick data
NinjaTrader 8 Market Replay data

You will build a synchronization validator that:

Compares tick sequences and timestamps
Generates a clear pass/fail sync report
Identifies divergence causes with precision

4. Fully Repeatable Pipeline

The system must support continuous ingestion without breaking structure, performance, or synchronization.

Who I Am Looking For

You are a match if you:

Have deep experience with data ingestion
Understand NinjaTrader 8’s data mechanics
Can build clean, scalable PostgreSQL systems
Care about precision, validation, and auditability
Communicate technical reasoning clearly
Deliver correct results the first time

If a 1-millisecond timestamp mismatch bothers you, this project will suit you.

Required Skills

PostgreSQL
Python
Tick-level modeling
ETL engineering
Ability to explain reasoning clearly
Understanding of NinjaTrader 8 is a strong advantage

What I Expect in Your Application (Non-Negotiable)

To avoid repeating past failures, your proposal must include:

1. A clear explanation of HOW you will execute the job

Not a generic offer.
Not a list of tools.
Not a recycled cover letter.

I need to see your reasoning and workflow:

Your A-to-Z plan
How you validate tick integrity
How you guarantee NinjaTrader parity
How you handle format discrepancies
How you design the schema
How you benchmark ingestion speed
How you maintain sync over time

You do not need to reveal proprietary techniques.
I simply want proof that you understand the terrain.

If you require sample data, replay files, screenshots, or structural examples to refine your plan, I will provide them when possible.

2. Estimated timeline and fixed-price bid

Time duration and price in this post is an indication, in the end you decide the price and timeline that reflects your expertise.

Why This Project Matters

This database becomes the single source of truth for my trading operations.
If the data is inaccurate, every downstream system fails.

This requires someone who treats the work as a mission:
calm, precise, structured, and fully accountable.

Compensation

Fixed-price contract
Performance bonus for flawless delivery
Guaranteed long-term work for the engineer who proves reliable

How to Apply

Include in your application:

A concise introduction
Your A-to-Z plan for achieving perfect sync
Your fixed-price bid and time duration
Your answers to the questions

I will review every proposal within the next week and contact selected candidates the week after.
Only applicants who clearly explain their methodology will be considered.",CDD,Data Engineering

Senior GCP Data Engineer (Python + BigQuery + Presidio + Vertex AI) for Chatbot Analytics,USA,Posted 2 weeks ago,2025-11-19T07:02:41.202Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Senior-GCP-span-class-highlight-Data-span-Engineer-Python-BigQuery-Presidio-Vertex-for-Chatbot-Analytics_~021991039406678778494/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"QUICK SUMMARY
We run a legal-information chatbot for domestic violence survivors and need a senior Google Cloud plus Python data engineer to build a secure, PII-aware data pipeline from raw text transcripts to anonymized text, then into BigQuery metrics, and finally a basic dashboard for grants.

This is primarily a data engineering and ETL role, with light analytics on top using BigQuery SQL and Looker Studio.

MUST-HAVE SKILLS (IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE)

Please only apply if you are strong in all of these:

1. Google Cloud Platform – BigQuery, GCS, IAM (senior level)
   - Designing and populating BigQuery tables for analytics
   - Loading data into BigQuery from Python
   - Designing GCS buckets, prefixes, lifecycle rules
   - Creating and using service accounts with least-privilege IAM

2. Python ETL and data pipelines (senior level)
   - Parsing semi-structured text files into structured records
   - Building small, reliable pipelines with logging, error handling, and configuration files
   - Comfortable working on a secure Mac environment (local scripts calling GCP)

3. PII detection and anonymization (strong experience)
   - Hands-on with Microsoft Presidio or similar tools
   - Combining regular expressions and NER to mask names, phone, email, addresses, case numbers, and similar data
   - Understands how to keep city, state, age and resource names while removing direct identifiers

4. LLM JSON extraction (Vertex AI preferred)
   - Calling an LLM from Python, ideally Vertex AI
   - Designing prompts that return strict JSON according to a known schema
   - Handling invalid JSON, retries, and logging failures safely

5. BigQuery SQL and basic BI (intermediate–senior)
   - Writing queries for monthly summaries and KPI tables
   - Understanding fact vs summary tables
   - Comfortable wiring BigQuery into a simple Looker Studio dashboard (we don’t need fancy design—just clear numbers and charts)

Nice-to-have:
- Looker Studio experience beyond basics
- Streamlit or Hex dashboards (for possible future phase)
- Work with sensitive domains (healthcare, legal, DV, mental health)

PROJECT OVERVIEW

We have:
- About 18 months of chatbot transcripts, roughly 500 conversations per month. Some conversations are very long, up to 100+ pages.
- A detailed technical spec (v1.1) describing the architecture.
- A 59-metric dictionary for what we want to extract.

You will implement a v1 pipeline:
- Secure Mac environment (Python + Presidio)
- -GCS buckets (raw, clean, metrics-json)
- -Vertex AI (one call per conversation)
- -BigQuery (conversations fact table + monthly_summary)
- -Looker Studio dashboard connected to those tables

The architecture is mostly defined, but we are open to your expert suggestions if they lower complexity, cost, or risk.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND DELIVERABLES

A. GCP Setup

- Create and configure GCS buckets, for example:
  - raw (raw .txt with PII, 90-day retention)
  - clean (anonymized conversations)
  - metrics-json (per-conversation metrics JSON)
- Create BigQuery dataset (for example, “statutefinder”) with:
  - conversations table (per conversation)
  - optional messages table (per message)
  - monthly_summary table or view
- Set up service accounts and IAM roles following least-privilege principles.

B. Script 1 – upload_to_gcs.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Upload local .txt transcript exports to path like:
  gs://raw-bucket/YYYYMMDD/filename.txt
- Log which files were uploaded and where.

C. Script 2 – anonymize_and_parse.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Read raw transcripts from GCS or local storage (pattern to be agreed).
- Split into individual conversations using the known delimiter line “CONVERSATION #” plus the header block.
- Parse and preserve header fields: ID, DATE, LOCATION, MODEL.
- Apply regular expressions and Presidio to redact PII in the conversation body:
  - survivor, abuser, and children names
  - phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, case/docket numbers, etc.
  - keep city, state, country, ages, and clearly “resource” organization names (courts, shelters)
- Write sanitized conversations back to the clean bucket as .txt or .json files.
- Nice-to-have: produce a CSV listing detected entities per conversation for human review.
- Important: reuse or extend our existing Presidio anonymizer from our GitHub organization (we will share the repo).

D. Script 3 – extract_metrics_to_bq.py

- Read anonymized conversations from clean bucket.
- Compute structural metrics such as message counts, word counts, abandoned conversations, etc.
- For each conversation, call Vertex AI once with an external prompt file to extract:
  - legal topics, abuse types, statutes mentioned
  - booleans such as protection order discussed, safety plan delivered, shelter guidance provided, emergency referral suggested
  - primary language
- Enforce valid JSON output and implement minimal retry with logging when the model returns malformed JSON.
- Write combined metrics JSON to metrics-json bucket.
- Load rows into BigQuery conversations table, including:
  - conversation_id, date/time, location fields, structural metrics, LLM metrics
  - batch_id, processed_at, metrics_prompt_version
- Ensure idempotency so the same conversation_id is not inserted twice.

E. Aggregations and Dashboard Hook

- Write BigQuery SQL to create or refresh monthly_summary from conversations.
- Optionally configure a scheduled query (for example, monthly).
- Help connect BigQuery to Looker Studio and build a simple v1 dashboard page:
  - headline metrics
  - topic breakdown
  - map by state
  Clarity matters more than design polish.

F. Documentation

- README.md with setup and run instructions for Scripts 1–3.
- SECURITY.md summarizing buckets, IAM, lifecycle rules, anonymization flow (high-level).
- METRICS_GUIDE.md explaining how stored/derived fields map to the 59-metric dictionary (we provide the sheet).
- requirements.txt listing Python dependencies (Presidio, Google Cloud client libraries, Vertex AI SDK, etc.).

CONSTRAINTS AND PRACTICAL NOTES

- Data volume: about 500 conversations per month; some conversations are very long.
- Budget: around 500 USD fixed price for this v1 scope.
- Timeline: target 3–4 weeks.
- The secure anonymization environment is a dedicated, encrypted Mac controlled by us.

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- We export a new text transcript batch on the Mac.
- We run your scripts or trigger the flow.
- New rows appear in conversations; monthly_summary is updated.
- The Looker Studio dashboard refreshes and shows the new month’s numbers.
- We do not re-run the LLM on older conversations.
- Raw PII only lives in the raw bucket and is auto-deleted after its retention period.

HOW TO APPLY

Start your proposal with the word “METRICS” so we know you read this.

In 4–6 short paragraphs, please answer:

1. GCP and BigQuery example – describe one project where you built a pipeline using GCS and BigQuery. What was your role, and what did the pipeline do?
2. PII and Presidio experience – have you used Microsoft Presidio or similar tools? In what context, and what kinds of PII did you anonymize?
3. LLM JSON extraction – describe one project where you called an LLM from Python and enforced strict JSON outputs. How did you handle invalid JSON or failures?
4. BigQuery and dashboards – briefly describe your experience preparing data for dashboards such as Looker Studio or similar tools.

If you do not have hands-on experience with GCP, Python ETL, PII anonymization, and LLM JSON extraction, this project is not a fit.",CDD,Data Engineering

Project type: Short-term consulting engagement (architecture & roadmap)
Duration: ~2 - 6 weeks (part-time, flexible)
Location: Remote

About the Project

We’re working with a rapidly growing automotive parts & vehicle recycling group that wants to stand up a modern, cost-efficient data & analytics platform.

They already have:

A central Postgres-based data lake (on-prem)

A consolidated Domo environment heavily used for reporting

A small but capable analytics team (lead + data engineer + data analyst, all contracted)

Existing proprietary dashboards, datasets, and analyses built around Domo 

Project Brief -

We now need an experienced data & analytics architect to guide us through defining the future-state architecture and designing a phased migration plan.

This is not a “do all the engineering work yourself” role. We’re looking for a senior consultant/architect who can shape the direction, pressure-test options, speak with vendors, and advise our team as we go.

What We Need Help With

You will partner with our team over ~2 weeks to:

Discovery & Current-State Assessment

Review the existing Domo environment (data sources, pipelines, admin model, cost structure)

Review the Postgres/on-prem “data lake” and surrounding data flows

Understand team capabilities, current pain points, and target use cases / maturity goals

Help us articulate success metrics for the future-state platform

Options Evaluation (End-to-End Architecture)

Identify required near-term and medium-term features and capabilities for:

Data ingestion / ELT

Data transformation / modeling

Cloud data warehouse / lakehouse

BI / analytics / self-service

Propose and compare 2–3 realistic architecture options (e.g. Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift vs others; dbt / ELT tooling; Tableau / Power BI / Looker / ThoughtSpot / etc.)

Do light cost modeling for each option: licenses, storage/compute, engineering/admin effort, support, etc.

Help us pressure-test vendor claims and talk directly with reps if needed (Domo, cloud DW, ELT, BI)

Future State & Roadmap

Recommend a target architecture and preferred stack aligned to the client’s goals, technical maturity, and budget ceiling (we need to demonstrate an annual run-rate under ~$100K for data & analytics ops over the next 3 years)

Outline a phased migration plan off the 3rd-party Domo setup:

High-level timeline

Key milestones

Risks & mitigations

Resource needs (internal vs external)

Provide a high-level roadmap for how the architecture can evolve with the business (e.g. data science, more advanced analytics, operational apps, etc.)

Expected Deliverables

We’re expecting polished but pragmatic consulting deliverables, such as:

Current-state assessment deck (what we have, what’s working, what’s not)

Options matrix comparing 2–3 target architectures (features, costs, risks, scoring)

Target architecture diagram + recommended stack (tools and how they fit together)

Annual operating expense estimate (base case + a couple of scaling scenarios)

Migration & roadmap deck with phases, milestones, resourcing, and key risks 

Project Brief - 

We’ll handle formatting/branding; we want your thinking, logic, and clarity.

Ideal Consultant Profile

We’re looking for someone who:

Has 5–10+ years of experience in data & analytics architecture, ideally with:

Cloud warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Synapse, etc.)

Transformation frameworks (e.g., dbt) and ELT/ETL tooling (Fivetran, Airbyte, custom pipelines)

Modern BI platforms (Domo, Tableau, Power BI, Looker, ThoughtSpot, etc.)

Has done this before: designed or re-designed a modern analytics stack for a mid-market or PE-backed company and/or led migration off Domo or a similar managed BI platform

Is comfortable working within a cost ceiling and can think in terms of TCO and OpEx, not just “cool tech”

Is confident talking to vendors / reps:

Asking pointed questions

Challenging pricing & architecture suggestions

Translating vendor speak into practical implications

Can communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders (CEO, Director of IT, Director of Business Transformation, etc.)

Is comfortable in an advisory / guide role:

You don’t need to write every line of code

You do need to help our team make good decisions, avoid dead ends, and keep the architecture coherent

Nice-to-haves:

Experience with automotive / manufacturing / multi-site operations or similar industries

Experience with PE-backed roll-up / buy-and-build environments

Background in both BI/reporting and data engineering (you can see both sides)

How We’ll Work Together

Timeline: Roughly 2 weeks from start, with a few structured workshops and async review

Format: Remote; mix of Zoom calls + async collaboration in docs/slides

Team: You’ll interact with the client’s leadership (CEO, IT, Integration/Transformation) and a small analytics team

What to Include in Your Proposal

Please include:

A short description of your relevant experience with:

Data & analytics architecture design

Domo and/or migrations off similar BI tools

Cost modeling / OpEx planning for data stacks

1–3 specific project examples where you:

Designed a modern analytics platform or migrated from one stack to another

Had to work within a clear budget constraint

Your proposed approach in 5–8 bullet points for the 2-week engagement

Your hourly rate and an estimated total hours for this scope

We’re looking for someone who can drop in, quickly understand the environment, challenge our assumptions, and leave us with a clear, defensible architecture and plan.

If that’s you, we’d like to talk.",CDD,Amazon Web Services

Data Engineer Needed — Build & Sync a Level 1 Tick Database With NinjaTrader 8,BEL,Posted yesterday,2025-12-01T06:57:39.802Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/span-class-highlight-Data-span-Engineer-Needed-Build-amp-Sync-Level-Tick-Database-With-NinjaTrader_~021995386796994959223/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"Project Type: Fixed-price
Long-term work available after successful delivery
Application window: One week to apply, one week to select the ideal candidate

Before You Apply
I’ve had several freelancers promise they could deliver this exact project. Every one of them failed.
I had to request refunds repeatedly.

You might be thinking: if multiple engineers failed, maybe the scope is unclear—or maybe this client is impossible to satisfy. Those are fair concerns. I've asked myself the same questions. If you've built systems where a single misaligned broke, you know the consequences it has downstream.

Let me be direct.
I know exactly what the end result must look like, and I immediately recognize whether someone understands the problem or is improvising.

To avoid wasting your time and mine, the selection process is designed to filter out amateurs and highlight true experts.

If you require specific files, formats, schema samples, or reference data to evaluate whether you are suitable for this job, I will provide them as long as it is technically possible and within my reach.
I want you to make an informed assessment before committing, and I am willing to supply whatever is necessary to support that.

The Job
Build a clean, scalable, perfectly synchronized PostgreSQL tick database, fully aligned with NinjaTrader 8 historical and live data.
The system must also support adding NinjaTrader Market Replay files later if needed.

If the data is wrong, the strategy fails.
This is precision-critical work.

What You Will Build
1. Production-Ready PostgreSQL Time-Series Database

Tick schema
1 index for millisecond accuracy
High-performance architecture optimized for analytics

2. Automated ETL Pipeline for Portara Tick Files

batch-insert architecture
Deduplication and timestamp normalization
Ability to append new datasets without drift

3. NinjaTrader 8 Synchronization Layer

You will ensure alignment between:

Portara tick data
NinjaTrader 8 Market Replay data

You will build a synchronization validator that:

Compares tick sequences and timestamps
Generates a clear pass/fail sync report
Identifies divergence causes with precision

4. Fully Repeatable Pipeline

The system must support continuous ingestion without breaking structure, performance, or synchronization.

Who I Am Looking For

You are a match if you:

Have deep experience with data ingestion
Understand NinjaTrader 8’s data mechanics
Can build clean, scalable PostgreSQL systems
Care about precision, validation, and auditability
Communicate technical reasoning clearly
Deliver correct results the first time

If a 1-millisecond timestamp mismatch bothers you, this project will suit you.

Required Skills

PostgreSQL
Python
Tick-level modeling
ETL engineering
Ability to explain reasoning clearly
Understanding of NinjaTrader 8 is a strong advantage

What I Expect in Your Application (Non-Negotiable)

To avoid repeating past failures, your proposal must include:

1. A clear explanation of HOW you will execute the job

Not a generic offer.
Not a list of tools.
Not a recycled cover letter.

I need to see your reasoning and workflow:

Your A-to-Z plan
How you validate tick integrity
How you guarantee NinjaTrader parity
How you handle format discrepancies
How you design the schema
How you benchmark ingestion speed
How you maintain sync over time

Senior GCP Data Engineer (Python + BigQuery + Presidio + Vertex AI) for Chatbot Analytics,USA,Posted 2 weeks ago,2025-11-19T07:02:41.202Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Senior-GCP-span-class-highlight-Data-span-Engineer-Python-BigQuery-Presidio-Vertex-for-Chatbot-Analytics_~021991039406678778494/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"QUICK SUMMARY
We run a legal-information chatbot for domestic violence survivors and need a senior Google Cloud plus Python data engineer to build a secure, PII-aware data pipeline from raw text transcripts to anonymized text, then into BigQuery metrics, and finally a basic dashboard for grants.

This is primarily a data engineering and ETL role, with light analytics on top using BigQuery SQL and Looker Studio.

MUST-HAVE SKILLS (IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE)

Please only apply if you are strong in all of these:

1. Google Cloud Platform – BigQuery, GCS, IAM (senior level)
   - Designing and populating BigQuery tables for analytics
   - Loading data into BigQuery from Python
   - Designing GCS buckets, prefixes, lifecycle rules
   - Creating and using service accounts with least-privilege IAM

2. Python ETL and data pipelines (senior level)
   - Parsing semi-structured text files into structured records
   - Building small, reliable pipelines with logging, error handling, and configuration files
   - Comfortable working on a secure Mac environment (local scripts calling GCP)

3. PII detection and anonymization (strong experience)
   - Hands-on with Microsoft Presidio or similar tools
   - Combining regular expressions and NER to mask names, phone, email, addresses, case numbers, and similar data
   - Understands how to keep city, state, age and resource names while removing direct identifiers

4. LLM JSON extraction (Vertex AI preferred)
   - Calling an LLM from Python, ideally Vertex AI
   - Designing prompts that return strict JSON according to a known schema
   - Handling invalid JSON, retries, and logging failures safely

5. BigQuery SQL and basic BI (intermediate–senior)
   - Writing queries for monthly summaries and KPI tables
   - Understanding fact vs summary tables
   - Comfortable wiring BigQuery into a simple Looker Studio dashboard (we don’t need fancy design—just clear numbers and charts)

Nice-to-have:
- Looker Studio experience beyond basics
- Streamlit or Hex dashboards (for possible future phase)
- Work with sensitive domains (healthcare, legal, DV, mental health)

PROJECT OVERVIEW

We have:
- About 18 months of chatbot transcripts, roughly 500 conversations per month. Some conversations are very long, up to 100+ pages.
- A detailed technical spec (v1.1) describing the architecture.
- A 59-metric dictionary for what we want to extract.

You will implement a v1 pipeline:
- Secure Mac environment (Python + Presidio)
- -GCS buckets (raw, clean, metrics-json)
- -Vertex AI (one call per conversation)
- -BigQuery (conversations fact table + monthly_summary)
- -Looker Studio dashboard connected to those tables

The architecture is mostly defined, but we are open to your expert suggestions if they lower complexity, cost, or risk.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND DELIVERABLES

A. GCP Setup

- Create and configure GCS buckets, for example:
  - raw (raw .txt with PII, 90-day retention)
  - clean (anonymized conversations)
  - metrics-json (per-conversation metrics JSON)
- Create BigQuery dataset (for example, “statutefinder”) with:
  - conversations table (per conversation)
  - optional messages table (per message)
  - monthly_summary table or view
- Set up service accounts and IAM roles following least-privilege principles.

B. Script 1 – upload_to_gcs.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Upload local .txt transcript exports to path like:
  gs://raw-bucket/YYYYMMDD/filename.txt
- Log which files were uploaded and where.

C. Script 2 – anonymize_and_parse.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Read raw transcripts from GCS or local storage (pattern to be agreed).
- Split into individual conversations using the known delimiter line “CONVERSATION #” plus the header block.
- Parse and preserve header fields: ID, DATE, LOCATION, MODEL.
- Apply regular expressions and Presidio to redact PII in the conversation body:
  - survivor, abuser, and children names
  - phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, case/docket numbers, etc.
  - keep city, state, country, ages, and clearly “resource” organization names (courts, shelters)
- Write sanitized conversations back to the clean bucket as .txt or .json files.
- Nice-to-have: produce a CSV listing detected entities per conversation for human review.
- Important: reuse or extend our existing Presidio anonymizer from our GitHub organization (we will share the repo).

D. Script 3 – extract_metrics_to_bq.py

- Read anonymized conversations from clean bucket.
- Compute structural metrics such as message counts, word counts, abandoned conversations, etc.
- For each conversation, call Vertex AI once with an external prompt file to extract:
  - legal topics, abuse types, statutes mentioned
  - booleans such as protection order discussed, safety plan delivered, shelter guidance provided, emergency referral suggested
  - primary language
- Enforce valid JSON output and implement minimal retry with logging when the model returns malformed JSON.
- Write combined metrics JSON to metrics-json bucket.
- Load rows into BigQuery conversations table, including:
  - conversation_id, date/time, location fields, structural metrics, LLM metrics
  - batch_id, processed_at, metrics_prompt_version
- Ensure idempotency so the same conversation_id is not inserted twice.

E. Aggregations and Dashboard Hook

- Write BigQuery SQL to create or refresh monthly_summary from conversations.
- Optionally configure a scheduled query (for example, monthly).
- Help connect BigQuery to Looker Studio and build a simple v1 dashboard page:
  - headline metrics
  - topic breakdown
  - map by state
  Clarity matters more than design polish.

F. Documentation

- README.md with setup and run instructions for Scripts 1–3.
- SECURITY.md summarizing buckets, IAM, lifecycle rules, anonymization flow (high-level).
- METRICS_GUIDE.md explaining how stored/derived fields map to the 59-metric dictionary (we provide the sheet).
- requirements.txt listing Python dependencies (Presidio, Google Cloud client libraries, Vertex AI SDK, etc.).

CONSTRAINTS AND PRACTICAL NOTES

- Data volume: about 500 conversations per month; some conversations are very long.
- Budget: around 500 USD fixed price for this v1 scope.
- Timeline: target 3–4 weeks.
- The secure anonymization environment is a dedicated, encrypted Mac controlled by us.

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- We export a new text transcript batch on the Mac.
- We run your scripts or trigger the flow.
- New rows appear in conversations; monthly_summary is updated.
- The Looker Studio dashboard refreshes and shows the new month’s numbers.
- We do not re-run the LLM on older conversations.
- Raw PII only lives in the raw bucket and is auto-deleted after its retention period.

HOW TO APPLY

Start your proposal with the word “METRICS” so we know you read this.

In 4–6 short paragraphs, please answer:

1. GCP and BigQuery example – describe one project where you built a pipeline using GCS and BigQuery. What was your role, and what did the pipeline do?
2. PII and Presidio experience – have you used Microsoft Presidio or similar tools? In what context, and what kinds of PII did you anonymize?
3. LLM JSON extraction – describe one project where you called an LLM from Python and enforced strict JSON outputs. How did you handle invalid JSON or failures?
4. BigQuery and dashboards – briefly describe your experience preparing data for dashboards such as Looker Studio or similar tools.

If you do not have hands-on experience with GCP, Python ETL, PII anonymization, and LLM JSON extraction, this project is not a fit.",CDD,Data Engineering

Project type: Short-term consulting engagement (architecture & roadmap)
Duration: ~2 - 6 weeks (part-time, flexible)
Location: Remote

About the Project

We’re working with a rapidly growing automotive parts & vehicle recycling group that wants to stand up a modern, cost-efficient data & analytics platform.

They already have:

A central Postgres-based data lake (on-prem)

A consolidated Domo environment heavily used for reporting

A small but capable analytics team (lead + data engineer + data analyst, all contracted)

Existing proprietary dashboards, datasets, and analyses built around Domo 

Project Brief -

We now need an experienced data & analytics architect to guide us through defining the future-state architecture and designing a phased migration plan.

This is not a “do all the engineering work yourself” role. We’re looking for a senior consultant/architect who can shape the direction, pressure-test options, speak with vendors, and advise our team as we go.

What We Need Help With

You will partner with our team over ~2 weeks to:

Discovery & Current-State Assessment

Review the existing Domo environment (data sources, pipelines, admin model, cost structure)

Review the Postgres/on-prem “data lake” and surrounding data flows

Understand team capabilities, current pain points, and target use cases / maturity goals

Help us articulate success metrics for the future-state platform

Options Evaluation (End-to-End Architecture)

Identify required near-term and medium-term features and capabilities for:

Data ingestion / ELT

Data transformation / modeling

Cloud data warehouse / lakehouse

BI / analytics / self-service

Propose and compare 2–3 realistic architecture options (e.g. Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift vs others; dbt / ELT tooling; Tableau / Power BI / Looker / ThoughtSpot / etc.)

Do light cost modeling for each option: licenses, storage/compute, engineering/admin effort, support, etc.

Help us pressure-test vendor claims and talk directly with reps if needed (Domo, cloud DW, ELT, BI)

Future State & Roadmap

Recommend a target architecture and preferred stack aligned to the client’s goals, technical maturity, and budget ceiling (we need to demonstrate an annual run-rate under ~$100K for data & analytics ops over the next 3 years)

Outline a phased migration plan off the 3rd-party Domo setup:

High-level timeline

Key milestones

Risks & mitigations

Resource needs (internal vs external)

Provide a high-level roadmap for how the architecture can evolve with the business (e.g. data science, more advanced analytics, operational apps, etc.)

Expected Deliverables

We’re expecting polished but pragmatic consulting deliverables, such as:

Current-state assessment deck (what we have, what’s working, what’s not)

Options matrix comparing 2–3 target architectures (features, costs, risks, scoring)

Target architecture diagram + recommended stack (tools and how they fit together)

Annual operating expense estimate (base case + a couple of scaling scenarios)

Migration & roadmap deck with phases, milestones, resourcing, and key risks 

Project Brief - 

We’ll handle formatting/branding; we want your thinking, logic, and clarity.

Ideal Consultant Profile

We’re looking for someone who:

Has 5–10+ years of experience in data & analytics architecture, ideally with:

Cloud warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Synapse, etc.)

Transformation frameworks (e.g., dbt) and ELT/ETL tooling (Fivetran, Airbyte, custom pipelines)

Modern BI platforms (Domo, Tableau, Power BI, Looker, ThoughtSpot, etc.)

Has done this before: designed or re-designed a modern analytics stack for a mid-market or PE-backed company and/or led migration off Domo or a similar managed BI platform

Is comfortable working within a cost ceiling and can think in terms of TCO and OpEx, not just “cool tech”

Is confident talking to vendors / reps:

Asking pointed questions

Challenging pricing & architecture suggestions

Translating vendor speak into practical implications

Can communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders (CEO, Director of IT, Director of Business Transformation, etc.)

Is comfortable in an advisory / guide role:

You don’t need to write every line of code

You do need to help our team make good decisions, avoid dead ends, and keep the architecture coherent

Nice-to-haves:

Experience with automotive / manufacturing / multi-site operations or similar industries

Experience with PE-backed roll-up / buy-and-build environments

Background in both BI/reporting and data engineering (you can see both sides)

How We’ll Work Together

Timeline: Roughly 2 weeks from start, with a few structured workshops and async review

Format: Remote; mix of Zoom calls + async collaboration in docs/slides

Team: You’ll interact with the client’s leadership (CEO, IT, Integration/Transformation) and a small analytics team

What to Include in Your Proposal

Please include:

A short description of your relevant experience with:

Data & analytics architecture design

Domo and/or migrations off similar BI tools

Cost modeling / OpEx planning for data stacks

1–3 specific project examples where you:

Designed a modern analytics platform or migrated from one stack to another

Had to work within a clear budget constraint

Your proposed approach in 5–8 bullet points for the 2-week engagement

Your hourly rate and an estimated total hours for this scope

We’re looking for someone who can drop in, quickly understand the environment, challenge our assumptions, and leave us with a clear, defensible architecture and plan.

If that’s you, we’d like to talk.",CDD,Amazon Web Services

Data Engineer Needed — Build & Sync a Level 1 Tick Database With NinjaTrader 8,BEL,Posted yesterday,2025-12-01T06:57:39.802Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/span-class-highlight-Data-span-Engineer-Needed-Build-amp-Sync-Level-Tick-Database-With-NinjaTrader_~021995386796994959223/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"Project Type: Fixed-price
Long-term work available after successful delivery
Application window: One week to apply, one week to select the ideal candidate

Before You Apply
I’ve had several freelancers promise they could deliver this exact project. Every one of them failed.
I had to request refunds repeatedly.

You might be thinking: if multiple engineers failed, maybe the scope is unclear—or maybe this client is impossible to satisfy. Those are fair concerns. I've asked myself the same questions. If you've built systems where a single misaligned broke, you know the consequences it has downstream.

Let me be direct.
I know exactly what the end result must look like, and I immediately recognize whether someone understands the problem or is improvising.

To avoid wasting your time and mine, the selection process is designed to filter out amateurs and highlight true experts.

If you require specific files, formats, schema samples, or reference data to evaluate whether you are suitable for this job, I will provide them as long as it is technically possible and within my reach.
I want you to make an informed assessment before committing, and I am willing to supply whatever is necessary to support that.

The Job
Build a clean, scalable, perfectly synchronized PostgreSQL tick database, fully aligned with NinjaTrader 8 historical and live data.
The system must also support adding NinjaTrader Market Replay files later if needed.

If the data is wrong, the strategy fails.
This is precision-critical work.

What You Will Build
1. Production-Ready PostgreSQL Time-Series Database

Tick schema
1 index for millisecond accuracy
High-performance architecture optimized for analytics

2. Automated ETL Pipeline for Portara Tick Files

batch-insert architecture
Deduplication and timestamp normalization
Ability to append new datasets without drift

3. NinjaTrader 8 Synchronization Layer

You will ensure alignment between:

Portara tick data
NinjaTrader 8 Market Replay data

You will build a synchronization validator that:

Compares tick sequences and timestamps
Generates a clear pass/fail sync report
Identifies divergence causes with precision

4. Fully Repeatable Pipeline

The system must support continuous ingestion without breaking structure, performance, or synchronization.

Who I Am Looking For

You are a match if you:

Have deep experience with data ingestion
Understand NinjaTrader 8’s data mechanics
Can build clean, scalable PostgreSQL systems
Care about precision, validation, and auditability
Communicate technical reasoning clearly
Deliver correct results the first time

If a 1-millisecond timestamp mismatch bothers you, this project will suit you.

Required Skills

PostgreSQL
Python
Tick-level modeling
ETL engineering
Ability to explain reasoning clearly
Understanding of NinjaTrader 8 is a strong advantage

What I Expect in Your Application (Non-Negotiable)

To avoid repeating past failures, your proposal must include:

1. A clear explanation of HOW you will execute the job

Not a generic offer.
Not a list of tools.
Not a recycled cover letter.

I need to see your reasoning and workflow:

Your A-to-Z plan
How you validate tick integrity
How you guarantee NinjaTrader parity
How you handle format discrepancies
How you design the schema
How you benchmark ingestion speed
How you maintain sync over time

You do not need to reveal proprietary techniques.
I simply want proof that you understand the terrain.

If you require sample data, replay files, screenshots, or structural examples to refine your plan, I will provide them when possible.

2. Estimated timeline and fixed-price bid

Time duration and price in this post is an indication, in the end you decide the price and timeline that reflects your expertise.

Why This Project Matters

This database becomes the single source of truth for my trading operations.
If the data is inaccurate, every downstream system fails.

This requires someone who treats the work as a mission:
calm, precise, structured, and fully accountable.

Compensation

Fixed-price contract
Performance bonus for flawless delivery
Guaranteed long-term work for the engineer who proves reliable

How to Apply

Include in your application:

A concise introduction
Your A-to-Z plan for achieving perfect sync
Your fixed-price bid and time duration
Your answers to the questions

I will review every proposal within the next week and contact selected candidates the week after.
Only applicants who clearly explain their methodology will be considered.",CDD,Data Engineering

We run a legal-information chatbot for domestic violence survivors and need a senior Google Cloud plus Python data engineer to build a secure, PII-aware data pipeline from raw text transcripts to anonymized text, then into BigQuery metrics, and finally a basic dashboard for grants.

This is primarily a data engineering and ETL role, with light analytics on top using BigQuery SQL and Looker Studio.

MUST-HAVE SKILLS (IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE)

Please only apply if you are strong in all of these:

1. Google Cloud Platform – BigQuery, GCS, IAM (senior level)
   - Designing and populating BigQuery tables for analytics
   - Loading data into BigQuery from Python
   - Designing GCS buckets, prefixes, lifecycle rules
   - Creating and using service accounts with least-privilege IAM

2. Python ETL and data pipelines (senior level)
   - Parsing semi-structured text files into structured records
   - Building small, reliable pipelines with logging, error handling, and configuration files
   - Comfortable working on a secure Mac environment (local scripts calling GCP)

3. PII detection and anonymization (strong experience)
   - Hands-on with Microsoft Presidio or similar tools
   - Combining regular expressions and NER to mask names, phone, email, addresses, case numbers, and similar data
   - Understands how to keep city, state, age and resource names while removing direct identifiers

4. LLM JSON extraction (Vertex AI preferred)
   - Calling an LLM from Python, ideally Vertex AI
   - Designing prompts that return strict JSON according to a known schema
   - Handling invalid JSON, retries, and logging failures safely

5. BigQuery SQL and basic BI (intermediate–senior)
   - Writing queries for monthly summaries and KPI tables
   - Understanding fact vs summary tables
   - Comfortable wiring BigQuery into a simple Looker Studio dashboard (we don’t need fancy design—just clear numbers and charts)

Nice-to-have:
- Looker Studio experience beyond basics
- Streamlit or Hex dashboards (for possible future phase)
- Work with sensitive domains (healthcare, legal, DV, mental health)

PROJECT OVERVIEW

We have:
- About 18 months of chatbot transcripts, roughly 500 conversations per month. Some conversations are very long, up to 100+ pages.
- A detailed technical spec (v1.1) describing the architecture.
- A 59-metric dictionary for what we want to extract.

You will implement a v1 pipeline:
- Secure Mac environment (Python + Presidio)
- -GCS buckets (raw, clean, metrics-json)
- -Vertex AI (one call per conversation)
- -BigQuery (conversations fact table + monthly_summary)
- -Looker Studio dashboard connected to those tables

The architecture is mostly defined, but we are open to your expert suggestions if they lower complexity, cost, or risk.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND DELIVERABLES

A. GCP Setup

- Create and configure GCS buckets, for example:
  - raw (raw .txt with PII, 90-day retention)
  - clean (anonymized conversations)
  - metrics-json (per-conversation metrics JSON)
- Create BigQuery dataset (for example, “statutefinder”) with:
  - conversations table (per conversation)
  - optional messages table (per message)
  - monthly_summary table or view
- Set up service accounts and IAM roles following least-privilege principles.

B. Script 1 – upload_to_gcs.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Upload local .txt transcript exports to path like:
  gs://raw-bucket/YYYYMMDD/filename.txt
- Log which files were uploaded and where.

C. Script 2 – anonymize_and_parse.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Read raw transcripts from GCS or local storage (pattern to be agreed).
- Split into individual conversations using the known delimiter line “CONVERSATION #” plus the header block.
- Parse and preserve header fields: ID, DATE, LOCATION, MODEL.
- Apply regular expressions and Presidio to redact PII in the conversation body:
  - survivor, abuser, and children names
  - phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, case/docket numbers, etc.
  - keep city, state, country, ages, and clearly “resource” organization names (courts, shelters)
- Write sanitized conversations back to the clean bucket as .txt or .json files.
- Nice-to-have: produce a CSV listing detected entities per conversation for human review.
- Important: reuse or extend our existing Presidio anonymizer from our GitHub organization (we will share the repo).

D. Script 3 – extract_metrics_to_bq.py

- Read anonymized conversations from clean bucket.
- Compute structural metrics such as message counts, word counts, abandoned conversations, etc.
- For each conversation, call Vertex AI once with an external prompt file to extract:
  - legal topics, abuse types, statutes mentioned
  - booleans such as protection order discussed, safety plan delivered, shelter guidance provided, emergency referral suggested
  - primary language
- Enforce valid JSON output and implement minimal retry with logging when the model returns malformed JSON.
- Write combined metrics JSON to metrics-json bucket.
- Load rows into BigQuery conversations table, including:
  - conversation_id, date/time, location fields, structural metrics, LLM metrics
  - batch_id, processed_at, metrics_prompt_version
- Ensure idempotency so the same conversation_id is not inserted twice.

E. Aggregations and Dashboard Hook

- Write BigQuery SQL to create or refresh monthly_summary from conversations.
- Optionally configure a scheduled query (for example, monthly).
- Help connect BigQuery to Looker Studio and build a simple v1 dashboard page:
  - headline metrics
  - topic breakdown
  - map by state
  Clarity matters more than design polish.

F. Documentation

- README.md with setup and run instructions for Scripts 1–3.
- SECURITY.md summarizing buckets, IAM, lifecycle rules, anonymization flow (high-level).
- METRICS_GUIDE.md explaining how stored/derived fields map to the 59-metric dictionary (we provide the sheet).
- requirements.txt listing Python dependencies (Presidio, Google Cloud client libraries, Vertex AI SDK, etc.).

CONSTRAINTS AND PRACTICAL NOTES

- Data volume: about 500 conversations per month; some conversations are very long.
- Budget: around 500 USD fixed price for this v1 scope.
- Timeline: target 3–4 weeks.
- The secure anonymization environment is a dedicated, encrypted Mac controlled by us.

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- We export a new text transcript batch on the Mac.
- We run your scripts or trigger the flow.
- New rows appear in conversations; monthly_summary is updated.
- The Looker Studio dashboard refreshes and shows the new month’s numbers.
- We do not re-run the LLM on older conversations.
- Raw PII only lives in the raw bucket and is auto-deleted after its retention period.

HOW TO APPLY

Start your proposal with the word “METRICS” so we know you read this.

In 4–6 short paragraphs, please answer:

1. GCP and BigQuery example – describe one project where you built a pipeline using GCS and BigQuery. What was your role, and what did the pipeline do?
2. PII and Presidio experience – have you used Microsoft Presidio or similar tools? In what context, and what kinds of PII did you anonymize?
3. LLM JSON extraction – describe one project where you called an LLM from Python and enforced strict JSON outputs. How did you handle invalid JSON or failures?
4. BigQuery and dashboards – briefly describe your experience preparing data for dashboards such as Looker Studio or similar tools.

If you do not have hands-on experience with GCP, Python ETL, PII anonymization, and LLM JSON extraction, this project is not a fit.",CDD,Data Engineering

Project type: Short-term consulting engagement (architecture & roadmap)
Duration: ~2 - 6 weeks (part-time, flexible)
Location: Remote

About the Project

We’re working with a rapidly growing automotive parts & vehicle recycling group that wants to stand up a modern, cost-efficient data & analytics platform.

They already have:

A central Postgres-based data lake (on-prem)

A consolidated Domo environment heavily used for reporting

A small but capable analytics team (lead + data engineer + data analyst, all contracted)

Existing proprietary dashboards, datasets, and analyses built around Domo 

Project Brief -

We now need an experienced data & analytics architect to guide us through defining the future-state architecture and designing a phased migration plan.

This is not a “do all the engineering work yourself” role. We’re looking for a senior consultant/architect who can shape the direction, pressure-test options, speak with vendors, and advise our team as we go.

What We Need Help With

You will partner with our team over ~2 weeks to:

Discovery & Current-State Assessment

Review the existing Domo environment (data sources, pipelines, admin model, cost structure)

Review the Postgres/on-prem “data lake” and surrounding data flows

Understand team capabilities, current pain points, and target use cases / maturity goals

Help us articulate success metrics for the future-state platform

Options Evaluation (End-to-End Architecture)

Identify required near-term and medium-term features and capabilities for:

Data ingestion / ELT

Data transformation / modeling

Cloud data warehouse / lakehouse

BI / analytics / self-service

Propose and compare 2–3 realistic architecture options (e.g. Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift vs others; dbt / ELT tooling; Tableau / Power BI / Looker / ThoughtSpot / etc.)

Do light cost modeling for each option: licenses, storage/compute, engineering/admin effort, support, etc.

Help us pressure-test vendor claims and talk directly with reps if needed (Domo, cloud DW, ELT, BI)

Future State & Roadmap

Recommend a target architecture and preferred stack aligned to the client’s goals, technical maturity, and budget ceiling (we need to demonstrate an annual run-rate under ~$100K for data & analytics ops over the next 3 years)

Outline a phased migration plan off the 3rd-party Domo setup:

High-level timeline

Key milestones

Risks & mitigations

Resource needs (internal vs external)

Provide a high-level roadmap for how the architecture can evolve with the business (e.g. data science, more advanced analytics, operational apps, etc.)

Expected Deliverables

We’re expecting polished but pragmatic consulting deliverables, such as:

Current-state assessment deck (what we have, what’s working, what’s not)

Options matrix comparing 2–3 target architectures (features, costs, risks, scoring)

Target architecture diagram + recommended stack (tools and how they fit together)

Annual operating expense estimate (base case + a couple of scaling scenarios)

Migration & roadmap deck with phases, milestones, resourcing, and key risks 

Project Brief - 

We’ll handle formatting/branding; we want your thinking, logic, and clarity.

Ideal Consultant Profile

We’re looking for someone who:

Has 5–10+ years of experience in data & analytics architecture, ideally with:

Cloud warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Synapse, etc.)

Transformation frameworks (e.g., dbt) and ELT/ETL tooling (Fivetran, Airbyte, custom pipelines)

Modern BI platforms (Domo, Tableau, Power BI, Looker, ThoughtSpot, etc.)

Has done this before: designed or re-designed a modern analytics stack for a mid-market or PE-backed company and/or led migration off Domo or a similar managed BI platform

Is comfortable working within a cost ceiling and can think in terms of TCO and OpEx, not just “cool tech”

Is confident talking to vendors / reps:

Asking pointed questions

Challenging pricing & architecture suggestions

Translating vendor speak into practical implications

Can communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders (CEO, Director of IT, Director of Business Transformation, etc.)

Is comfortable in an advisory / guide role:

You don’t need to write every line of code

You do need to help our team make good decisions, avoid dead ends, and keep the architecture coherent

Nice-to-haves:

Experience with automotive / manufacturing / multi-site operations or similar industries

Experience with PE-backed roll-up / buy-and-build environments

Background in both BI/reporting and data engineering (you can see both sides)

How We’ll Work Together

Timeline: Roughly 2 weeks from start, with a few structured workshops and async review

Format: Remote; mix of Zoom calls + async collaboration in docs/slides

Team: You’ll interact with the client’s leadership (CEO, IT, Integration/Transformation) and a small analytics team

What to Include in Your Proposal

Please include:

A short description of your relevant experience with:

Data & analytics architecture design

Domo and/or migrations off similar BI tools

Cost modeling / OpEx planning for data stacks

1–3 specific project examples where you:

Designed a modern analytics platform or migrated from one stack to another

Had to work within a clear budget constraint

Your proposed approach in 5–8 bullet points for the 2-week engagement

Your hourly rate and an estimated total hours for this scope

We’re looking for someone who can drop in, quickly understand the environment, challenge our assumptions, and leave us with a clear, defensible architecture and plan.

Data Engineer Needed — Build & Sync a Level 1 Tick Database With NinjaTrader 8,BEL,Posted yesterday,2025-12-01T06:57:39.802Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/span-class-highlight-Data-span-Engineer-Needed-Build-amp-Sync-Level-Tick-Database-With-NinjaTrader_~021995386796994959223/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"Project Type: Fixed-price
Long-term work available after successful delivery
Application window: One week to apply, one week to select the ideal candidate

Before You Apply
I’ve had several freelancers promise they could deliver this exact project. Every one of them failed.
I had to request refunds repeatedly.

You might be thinking: if multiple engineers failed, maybe the scope is unclear—or maybe this client is impossible to satisfy. Those are fair concerns. I've asked myself the same questions. If you've built systems where a single misaligned broke, you know the consequences it has downstream.

Let me be direct.
I know exactly what the end result must look like, and I immediately recognize whether someone understands the problem or is improvising.

To avoid wasting your time and mine, the selection process is designed to filter out amateurs and highlight true experts.

If you require specific files, formats, schema samples, or reference data to evaluate whether you are suitable for this job, I will provide them as long as it is technically possible and within my reach.
I want you to make an informed assessment before committing, and I am willing to supply whatever is necessary to support that.

The Job
Build a clean, scalable, perfectly synchronized PostgreSQL tick database, fully aligned with NinjaTrader 8 historical and live data.
The system must also support adding NinjaTrader Market Replay files later if needed.

If the data is wrong, the strategy fails.
This is precision-critical work.

What You Will Build
1. Production-Ready PostgreSQL Time-Series Database

Tick schema
1 index for millisecond accuracy
High-performance architecture optimized for analytics

2. Automated ETL Pipeline for Portara Tick Files

batch-insert architecture
Deduplication and timestamp normalization
Ability to append new datasets without drift

3. NinjaTrader 8 Synchronization Layer

You will ensure alignment between:

Portara tick data
NinjaTrader 8 Market Replay data

You will build a synchronization validator that:

Compares tick sequences and timestamps
Generates a clear pass/fail sync report
Identifies divergence causes with precision

4. Fully Repeatable Pipeline

The system must support continuous ingestion without breaking structure, performance, or synchronization.

Who I Am Looking For

You are a match if you:

Have deep experience with data ingestion
Understand NinjaTrader 8’s data mechanics
Can build clean, scalable PostgreSQL systems
Care about precision, validation, and auditability
Communicate technical reasoning clearly
Deliver correct results the first time

If a 1-millisecond timestamp mismatch bothers you, this project will suit you.

Required Skills

PostgreSQL
Python
Tick-level modeling
ETL engineering
Ability to explain reasoning clearly
Understanding of NinjaTrader 8 is a strong advantage

What I Expect in Your Application (Non-Negotiable)

To avoid repeating past failures, your proposal must include:

1. A clear explanation of HOW you will execute the job

Not a generic offer.
Not a list of tools.
Not a recycled cover letter.

I need to see your reasoning and workflow:

Your A-to-Z plan
How you validate tick integrity
How you guarantee NinjaTrader parity
How you handle format discrepancies
How you design the schema
How you benchmark ingestion speed
How you maintain sync over time

You do not need to reveal proprietary techniques.
I simply want proof that you understand the terrain.

If you require sample data, replay files, screenshots, or structural examples to refine your plan, I will provide them when possible.

2. Estimated timeline and fixed-price bid

Time duration and price in this post is an indication, in the end you decide the price and timeline that reflects your expertise.

Why This Project Matters

This database becomes the single source of truth for my trading operations.
If the data is inaccurate, every downstream system fails.

This requires someone who treats the work as a mission:
calm, precise, structured, and fully accountable.

Compensation

Fixed-price contract
Performance bonus for flawless delivery
Guaranteed long-term work for the engineer who proves reliable

How to Apply

Include in your application:

A concise introduction
Your A-to-Z plan for achieving perfect sync
Your fixed-price bid and time duration
Your answers to the questions

I will review every proposal within the next week and contact selected candidates the week after.
Only applicants who clearly explain their methodology will be considered.",CDD,Data Engineering

Senior GCP Data Engineer (Python + BigQuery + Presidio + Vertex AI) for Chatbot Analytics,USA,Posted 2 weeks ago,2025-11-19T07:02:41.202Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Senior-GCP-span-class-highlight-Data-span-Engineer-Python-BigQuery-Presidio-Vertex-for-Chatbot-Analytics_~021991039406678778494/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"QUICK SUMMARY
We run a legal-information chatbot for domestic violence survivors and need a senior Google Cloud plus Python data engineer to build a secure, PII-aware data pipeline from raw text transcripts to anonymized text, then into BigQuery metrics, and finally a basic dashboard for grants.

This is primarily a data engineering and ETL role, with light analytics on top using BigQuery SQL and Looker Studio.

MUST-HAVE SKILLS (IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE)

Please only apply if you are strong in all of these:

1. Google Cloud Platform – BigQuery, GCS, IAM (senior level)
   - Designing and populating BigQuery tables for analytics
   - Loading data into BigQuery from Python
   - Designing GCS buckets, prefixes, lifecycle rules
   - Creating and using service accounts with least-privilege IAM

2. Python ETL and data pipelines (senior level)
   - Parsing semi-structured text files into structured records
   - Building small, reliable pipelines with logging, error handling, and configuration files
   - Comfortable working on a secure Mac environment (local scripts calling GCP)

3. PII detection and anonymization (strong experience)
   - Hands-on with Microsoft Presidio or similar tools
   - Combining regular expressions and NER to mask names, phone, email, addresses, case numbers, and similar data
   - Understands how to keep city, state, age and resource names while removing direct identifiers

4. LLM JSON extraction (Vertex AI preferred)
   - Calling an LLM from Python, ideally Vertex AI
   - Designing prompts that return strict JSON according to a known schema
   - Handling invalid JSON, retries, and logging failures safely

5. BigQuery SQL and basic BI (intermediate–senior)
   - Writing queries for monthly summaries and KPI tables
   - Understanding fact vs summary tables
   - Comfortable wiring BigQuery into a simple Looker Studio dashboard (we don’t need fancy design—just clear numbers and charts)

Nice-to-have:
- Looker Studio experience beyond basics
- Streamlit or Hex dashboards (for possible future phase)
- Work with sensitive domains (healthcare, legal, DV, mental health)

PROJECT OVERVIEW

We have:
- About 18 months of chatbot transcripts, roughly 500 conversations per month. Some conversations are very long, up to 100+ pages.
- A detailed technical spec (v1.1) describing the architecture.
- A 59-metric dictionary for what we want to extract.

You will implement a v1 pipeline:
- Secure Mac environment (Python + Presidio)
- -GCS buckets (raw, clean, metrics-json)
- -Vertex AI (one call per conversation)
- -BigQuery (conversations fact table + monthly_summary)
- -Looker Studio dashboard connected to those tables

The architecture is mostly defined, but we are open to your expert suggestions if they lower complexity, cost, or risk.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND DELIVERABLES

A. GCP Setup

- Create and configure GCS buckets, for example:
  - raw (raw .txt with PII, 90-day retention)
  - clean (anonymized conversations)
  - metrics-json (per-conversation metrics JSON)
- Create BigQuery dataset (for example, “statutefinder”) with:
  - conversations table (per conversation)
  - optional messages table (per message)
  - monthly_summary table or view
- Set up service accounts and IAM roles following least-privilege principles.

B. Script 1 – upload_to_gcs.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Upload local .txt transcript exports to path like:
  gs://raw-bucket/YYYYMMDD/filename.txt
- Log which files were uploaded and where.

C. Script 2 – anonymize_and_parse.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Read raw transcripts from GCS or local storage (pattern to be agreed).
- Split into individual conversations using the known delimiter line “CONVERSATION #” plus the header block.
- Parse and preserve header fields: ID, DATE, LOCATION, MODEL.
- Apply regular expressions and Presidio to redact PII in the conversation body:
  - survivor, abuser, and children names
  - phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, case/docket numbers, etc.
  - keep city, state, country, ages, and clearly “resource” organization names (courts, shelters)
- Write sanitized conversations back to the clean bucket as .txt or .json files.
- Nice-to-have: produce a CSV listing detected entities per conversation for human review.
- Important: reuse or extend our existing Presidio anonymizer from our GitHub organization (we will share the repo).

D. Script 3 – extract_metrics_to_bq.py

- Read anonymized conversations from clean bucket.
- Compute structural metrics such as message counts, word counts, abandoned conversations, etc.
- For each conversation, call Vertex AI once with an external prompt file to extract:
  - legal topics, abuse types, statutes mentioned
  - booleans such as protection order discussed, safety plan delivered, shelter guidance provided, emergency referral suggested
  - primary language
- Enforce valid JSON output and implement minimal retry with logging when the model returns malformed JSON.
- Write combined metrics JSON to metrics-json bucket.
- Load rows into BigQuery conversations table, including:
  - conversation_id, date/time, location fields, structural metrics, LLM metrics
  - batch_id, processed_at, metrics_prompt_version
- Ensure idempotency so the same conversation_id is not inserted twice.

E. Aggregations and Dashboard Hook

- Write BigQuery SQL to create or refresh monthly_summary from conversations.
- Optionally configure a scheduled query (for example, monthly).
- Help connect BigQuery to Looker Studio and build a simple v1 dashboard page:
  - headline metrics
  - topic breakdown
  - map by state
  Clarity matters more than design polish.

F. Documentation

- README.md with setup and run instructions for Scripts 1–3.
- SECURITY.md summarizing buckets, IAM, lifecycle rules, anonymization flow (high-level).
- METRICS_GUIDE.md explaining how stored/derived fields map to the 59-metric dictionary (we provide the sheet).
- requirements.txt listing Python dependencies (Presidio, Google Cloud client libraries, Vertex AI SDK, etc.).

CONSTRAINTS AND PRACTICAL NOTES

- Data volume: about 500 conversations per month; some conversations are very long.
- Budget: around 500 USD fixed price for this v1 scope.
- Timeline: target 3–4 weeks.
- The secure anonymization environment is a dedicated, encrypted Mac controlled by us.

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- We export a new text transcript batch on the Mac.
- We run your scripts or trigger the flow.
- New rows appear in conversations; monthly_summary is updated.
- The Looker Studio dashboard refreshes and shows the new month’s numbers.
- We do not re-run the LLM on older conversations.
- Raw PII only lives in the raw bucket and is auto-deleted after its retention period.

HOW TO APPLY

Start your proposal with the word “METRICS” so we know you read this.

In 4–6 short paragraphs, please answer:

1. GCP and BigQuery example – describe one project where you built a pipeline using GCS and BigQuery. What was your role, and what did the pipeline do?
2. PII and Presidio experience – have you used Microsoft Presidio or similar tools? In what context, and what kinds of PII did you anonymize?
3. LLM JSON extraction – describe one project where you called an LLM from Python and enforced strict JSON outputs. How did you handle invalid JSON or failures?
4. BigQuery and dashboards – briefly describe your experience preparing data for dashboards such as Looker Studio or similar tools.

If you do not have hands-on experience with GCP, Python ETL, PII anonymization, and LLM JSON extraction, this project is not a fit.",CDD,Data Engineering

Project type: Short-term consulting engagement (architecture & roadmap)
Duration: ~2 - 6 weeks (part-time, flexible)
Location: Remote

About the Project

We’re working with a rapidly growing automotive parts & vehicle recycling group that wants to stand up a modern, cost-efficient data & analytics platform.

They already have:

A central Postgres-based data lake (on-prem)

A consolidated Domo environment heavily used for reporting

A small but capable analytics team (lead + data engineer + data analyst, all contracted)

Existing proprietary dashboards, datasets, and analyses built around Domo 

Project Brief -

We now need an experienced data & analytics architect to guide us through defining the future-state architecture and designing a phased migration plan.

This is not a “do all the engineering work yourself” role. We’re looking for a senior consultant/architect who can shape the direction, pressure-test options, speak with vendors, and advise our team as we go.

What We Need Help With

You will partner with our team over ~2 weeks to:

Discovery & Current-State Assessment

Review the existing Domo environment (data sources, pipelines, admin model, cost structure)

Review the Postgres/on-prem “data lake” and surrounding data flows

Understand team capabilities, current pain points, and target use cases / maturity goals

Help us articulate success metrics for the future-state platform

Options Evaluation (End-to-End Architecture)

Identify required near-term and medium-term features and capabilities for:

Data ingestion / ELT

Data transformation / modeling

Cloud data warehouse / lakehouse

BI / analytics / self-service

Propose and compare 2–3 realistic architecture options (e.g. Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift vs others; dbt / ELT tooling; Tableau / Power BI / Looker / ThoughtSpot / etc.)

Do light cost modeling for each option: licenses, storage/compute, engineering/admin effort, support, etc.

Help us pressure-test vendor claims and talk directly with reps if needed (Domo, cloud DW, ELT, BI)

Future State & Roadmap

Recommend a target architecture and preferred stack aligned to the client’s goals, technical maturity, and budget ceiling (we need to demonstrate an annual run-rate under ~$100K for data & analytics ops over the next 3 years)

Outline a phased migration plan off the 3rd-party Domo setup:

High-level timeline

Key milestones

Risks & mitigations

Resource needs (internal vs external)

Provide a high-level roadmap for how the architecture can evolve with the business (e.g. data science, more advanced analytics, operational apps, etc.)

Expected Deliverables

We’re expecting polished but pragmatic consulting deliverables, such as:

Current-state assessment deck (what we have, what’s working, what’s not)

Options matrix comparing 2–3 target architectures (features, costs, risks, scoring)

Target architecture diagram + recommended stack (tools and how they fit together)

Annual operating expense estimate (base case + a couple of scaling scenarios)

Migration & roadmap deck with phases, milestones, resourcing, and key risks 

Project Brief - 

We’ll handle formatting/branding; we want your thinking, logic, and clarity.

Ideal Consultant Profile

We’re looking for someone who:

Has 5–10+ years of experience in data & analytics architecture, ideally with:

Cloud warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Synapse, etc.)

Transformation frameworks (e.g., dbt) and ELT/ETL tooling (Fivetran, Airbyte, custom pipelines)

Modern BI platforms (Domo, Tableau, Power BI, Looker, ThoughtSpot, etc.)

Has done this before: designed or re-designed a modern analytics stack for a mid-market or PE-backed company and/or led migration off Domo or a similar managed BI platform

Is comfortable working within a cost ceiling and can think in terms of TCO and OpEx, not just “cool tech”

Is confident talking to vendors / reps:

Asking pointed questions

Challenging pricing & architecture suggestions

Translating vendor speak into practical implications

Can communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders (CEO, Director of IT, Director of Business Transformation, etc.)

Is comfortable in an advisory / guide role:

You don’t need to write every line of code

You do need to help our team make good decisions, avoid dead ends, and keep the architecture coherent

Nice-to-haves:

Experience with automotive / manufacturing / multi-site operations or similar industries

Experience with PE-backed roll-up / buy-and-build environments

Background in both BI/reporting and data engineering (you can see both sides)

How We’ll Work Together

Timeline: Roughly 2 weeks from start, with a few structured workshops and async review

Format: Remote; mix of Zoom calls + async collaboration in docs/slides

Team: You’ll interact with the client’s leadership (CEO, IT, Integration/Transformation) and a small analytics team

What to Include in Your Proposal

Please include:

A short description of your relevant experience with:

Data & analytics architecture design

Domo and/or migrations off similar BI tools

Cost modeling / OpEx planning for data stacks

1–3 specific project examples where you:

Designed a modern analytics platform or migrated from one stack to another

Had to work within a clear budget constraint

Your proposed approach in 5–8 bullet points for the 2-week engagement

Your hourly rate and an estimated total hours for this scope

We’re looking for someone who can drop in, quickly understand the environment, challenge our assumptions, and leave us with a clear, defensible architecture and plan.

If that’s you, we’d like to talk.",CDD,Amazon Web Services

Multi-Timeframe Trend Recognition System
Project Title:

Development of a Multi-Timeframe Trend-Following Engine with Telegram Integration

Background & Objective:

We are transitioning from a short-term 15-minute trading signal model to a more advanced system that can recognize, track, and communicate multi-hour trend movements.

The goal is to build a trend-following engine that understands market structure (A → B → C), maintains memory of past movements, and delivers more meaningful, context-aware trading insights through Telegram.

Scope of Work:

This is a new development phase, not a modification of the existing system. The proposed work includes:

1. Trend Classification

Build machine learning classifiers for:

1-Hour

4-Hour

Daily timeframes

2. Trend Memory Module

Implement logic to track ongoing trends and remember direction/state across timeframes

3. Signal Fusion Engine

Combine long-term trend direction with short-term movements to identify:

Pullbacks vs. Reversals

Trend Continuation opportunities

4. Telegram Message Layering

Redesign output messages to reflect:

Multi-timeframe trend bias (e.g., “1H Long Bias | 5m Pullback”)

Momentum and structural changes in real time

5. Evaluation & Backtesting

Develop robust backtesting logic to validate:

Trend accuracy

Signal stability

Trade-worthiness

6. Deployment

Integrate with the current infrastructure

Live testing and performance monitoring

Deliverables:

Working trend classifiers (1H, 4H, Daily)

Trend memory logic

Signal fusion system

Updated Telegram output system

Backtesting reports

Deployment-ready codebase

Additional 

Since we’re providing an additional model to support this system, we’d like to explore adding a few extra layers to enhance trade decision-making and overall system performance. Here’s what we’re thinking:

Entry Timing Layer

Helps pinpoint optimal low-risk entry points within a confirmed trend.

Risk Level Classification

Labels trend conditions as High Confidence, Moderate, or Unclear.

Trend Strength Scoring

Adds a numerical score to rate the strength of the current trend.

Reversal Alert Layer

Detects early signs of exhaustion or possible trend reversals.

Time-of-Day Sensitivity

Adjusts signal confidence based on trading session timing.

Trade Setup Type Labeling

Tags signals as Breakout, Pullback, Trend Continuation, or Reversal.

Trade Context Commentary (Optional)

Adds brief reasoning to Telegram alerts (e.g., “4H uptrend, 50m pullback to 20EMA”).

Historical Signal Heatmap (Optional Tool)

Visual breakdown of where past signals occurred and how they performed.",CDD,AI Agent Development

Senior GCP Data Engineer (Python + BigQuery + Presidio + Vertex AI) for Chatbot Analytics,USA,Posted 2 weeks ago,2025-11-19T07:02:41.202Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Senior-GCP-span-class-highlight-Data-span-Engineer-Python-BigQuery-Presidio-Vertex-for-Chatbot-Analytics_~021991039406678778494/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"QUICK SUMMARY
We run a legal-information chatbot for domestic violence survivors and need a senior Google Cloud plus Python data engineer to build a secure, PII-aware data pipeline from raw text transcripts to anonymized text, then into BigQuery metrics, and finally a basic dashboard for grants.

This is primarily a data engineering and ETL role, with light analytics on top using BigQuery SQL and Looker Studio.

MUST-HAVE SKILLS (IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE)

Please only apply if you are strong in all of these:

1. Google Cloud Platform – BigQuery, GCS, IAM (senior level)
   - Designing and populating BigQuery tables for analytics
   - Loading data into BigQuery from Python
   - Designing GCS buckets, prefixes, lifecycle rules
   - Creating and using service accounts with least-privilege IAM

2. Python ETL and data pipelines (senior level)
   - Parsing semi-structured text files into structured records
   - Building small, reliable pipelines with logging, error handling, and configuration files
   - Comfortable working on a secure Mac environment (local scripts calling GCP)

3. PII detection and anonymization (strong experience)
   - Hands-on with Microsoft Presidio or similar tools
   - Combining regular expressions and NER to mask names, phone, email, addresses, case numbers, and similar data
   - Understands how to keep city, state, age and resource names while removing direct identifiers

4. LLM JSON extraction (Vertex AI preferred)
   - Calling an LLM from Python, ideally Vertex AI
   - Designing prompts that return strict JSON according to a known schema
   - Handling invalid JSON, retries, and logging failures safely

5. BigQuery SQL and basic BI (intermediate–senior)
   - Writing queries for monthly summaries and KPI tables
   - Understanding fact vs summary tables
   - Comfortable wiring BigQuery into a simple Looker Studio dashboard (we don’t need fancy design—just clear numbers and charts)

Nice-to-have:
- Looker Studio experience beyond basics
- Streamlit or Hex dashboards (for possible future phase)
- Work with sensitive domains (healthcare, legal, DV, mental health)

PROJECT OVERVIEW

We have:
- About 18 months of chatbot transcripts, roughly 500 conversations per month. Some conversations are very long, up to 100+ pages.
- A detailed technical spec (v1.1) describing the architecture.
- A 59-metric dictionary for what we want to extract.

You will implement a v1 pipeline:
- Secure Mac environment (Python + Presidio)
- -GCS buckets (raw, clean, metrics-json)
- -Vertex AI (one call per conversation)
- -BigQuery (conversations fact table + monthly_summary)
- -Looker Studio dashboard connected to those tables

The architecture is mostly defined, but we are open to your expert suggestions if they lower complexity, cost, or risk.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND DELIVERABLES

A. GCP Setup

- Create and configure GCS buckets, for example:
  - raw (raw .txt with PII, 90-day retention)
  - clean (anonymized conversations)
  - metrics-json (per-conversation metrics JSON)
- Create BigQuery dataset (for example, “statutefinder”) with:
  - conversations table (per conversation)
  - optional messages table (per message)
  - monthly_summary table or view
- Set up service accounts and IAM roles following least-privilege principles.

B. Script 1 – upload_to_gcs.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Upload local .txt transcript exports to path like:
  gs://raw-bucket/YYYYMMDD/filename.txt
- Log which files were uploaded and where.

C. Script 2 – anonymize_and_parse.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Read raw transcripts from GCS or local storage (pattern to be agreed).
- Split into individual conversations using the known delimiter line “CONVERSATION #” plus the header block.
- Parse and preserve header fields: ID, DATE, LOCATION, MODEL.
- Apply regular expressions and Presidio to redact PII in the conversation body:
  - survivor, abuser, and children names
  - phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, case/docket numbers, etc.
  - keep city, state, country, ages, and clearly “resource” organization names (courts, shelters)
- Write sanitized conversations back to the clean bucket as .txt or .json files.
- Nice-to-have: produce a CSV listing detected entities per conversation for human review.
- Important: reuse or extend our existing Presidio anonymizer from our GitHub organization (we will share the repo).

D. Script 3 – extract_metrics_to_bq.py

- Read anonymized conversations from clean bucket.
- Compute structural metrics such as message counts, word counts, abandoned conversations, etc.
- For each conversation, call Vertex AI once with an external prompt file to extract:
  - legal topics, abuse types, statutes mentioned
  - booleans such as protection order discussed, safety plan delivered, shelter guidance provided, emergency referral suggested
  - primary language
- Enforce valid JSON output and implement minimal retry with logging when the model returns malformed JSON.
- Write combined metrics JSON to metrics-json bucket.
- Load rows into BigQuery conversations table, including:
  - conversation_id, date/time, location fields, structural metrics, LLM metrics
  - batch_id, processed_at, metrics_prompt_version
- Ensure idempotency so the same conversation_id is not inserted twice.

E. Aggregations and Dashboard Hook

- Write BigQuery SQL to create or refresh monthly_summary from conversations.
- Optionally configure a scheduled query (for example, monthly).
- Help connect BigQuery to Looker Studio and build a simple v1 dashboard page:
  - headline metrics
  - topic breakdown
  - map by state
  Clarity matters more than design polish.

F. Documentation

- README.md with setup and run instructions for Scripts 1–3.
- SECURITY.md summarizing buckets, IAM, lifecycle rules, anonymization flow (high-level).
- METRICS_GUIDE.md explaining how stored/derived fields map to the 59-metric dictionary (we provide the sheet).
- requirements.txt listing Python dependencies (Presidio, Google Cloud client libraries, Vertex AI SDK, etc.).

CONSTRAINTS AND PRACTICAL NOTES

- Data volume: about 500 conversations per month; some conversations are very long.
- Budget: around 500 USD fixed price for this v1 scope.
- Timeline: target 3–4 weeks.
- The secure anonymization environment is a dedicated, encrypted Mac controlled by us.

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- We export a new text transcript batch on the Mac.
- We run your scripts or trigger the flow.
- New rows appear in conversations; monthly_summary is updated.
- The Looker Studio dashboard refreshes and shows the new month’s numbers.
- We do not re-run the LLM on older conversations.
- Raw PII only lives in the raw bucket and is auto-deleted after its retention period.

HOW TO APPLY

Start your proposal with the word “METRICS” so we know you read this.

In 4–6 short paragraphs, please answer:

1. GCP and BigQuery example – describe one project where you built a pipeline using GCS and BigQuery. What was your role, and what did the pipeline do?
2. PII and Presidio experience – have you used Microsoft Presidio or similar tools? In what context, and what kinds of PII did you anonymize?
3. LLM JSON extraction – describe one project where you called an LLM from Python and enforced strict JSON outputs. How did you handle invalid JSON or failures?
4. BigQuery and dashboards – briefly describe your experience preparing data for dashboards such as Looker Studio or similar tools.

If you do not have hands-on experience with GCP, Python ETL, PII anonymization, and LLM JSON extraction, this project is not a fit.",CDD,Data Engineering

We have a half built code base with a ready system prompt, we are looking for someone to take it up & complete the product in a couple of weeks. Since we had to focus on another product, we couldn't complete this agent. 

Agent role: 

The agent needs to understand property buyer query, guage intent, dynamically route to these tools, fetch the best-match properties based on user criteria, move the conversation forward towards setting up a sales call between the company & the property buyer (goal) and finally assess lead intent to purchase (high/low/med) based on the chat.

Technical context:

A. Tools used in the agent:
1. T2SQL (a small DB of less than 5,000 rows with real estate units list)
2. Vector search on some text information on location, features about these properties
3. Web search for certain types of queries. 

Agent needs to dynamically route to one or more tools. 

B. Current technical issues:
1. Tool call failures
2. Incorrect property match retrieval from T2SQL tool
3. Agent stuck in loop at times
4. Higher latency than expected for conversational AI sales agent (expected: 5 to 8 secs max)

Scope clarity:

No extraction element involved, pipelines in place, work is to be done only on the agent system & back-end APIs (there's base code available even for back-end already, no need to build from scratch). Co-ordinate with our FE engineer on the API integration with FE dashboards. No voice tool, just website chat & WhatsApp API integration.

Error handling & Human-in-loop escalation notification to be built. Monitoring, logging to be set up on our existing LangFuse account. 

Support provided:
1. LLM APIs, full infra access, access to current code base on which refinement is expected
2. Product manager feedback on iterations carried out to assess response accuracy & completeness

The data is currently in CSV form and has been merged from multiple sources such as clinical tables, wearable glucose, activity monitor, environmental exposure, ECG or HRV, and participant metadata.
Data cleaning, joining on person_id, handling encoded nulls, basic imputation, and standardization have already been done in Python.

Now I need an experienced person to turn this dataset into a proper supervised predictive disease diagnosis project using tools from the Hadoop ecosystem.

Tasks to be done
1. Define the prediction label
- From the available columns such as study_group, clinical measurements like HbA1c or glucose related fields, create a clear target variable. It can be binary such as diabetic vs non diabetic or multi class such as healthy, lifestyle controlled, medication controlled, insulin dependent.
- Document the logic clearly so that we can justify the label creation.
- Handle class imbalance if the data is skewed.

2. Prepare the final modeling dataset
- Start from the merged file that I will provide.
- Select relevant features and drop id or leakage columns.
- Make sure categorical columns such as clinical_site, study_group, recommended_split are encoded in a way that works with Hive or Spark or Mahout.
- Output a clean modeling ready dataset in CSV or Parquet.

3. Load into Hadoop or Hive
- Upload the final dataset to HDFS.
- Create a Hive table on top of it and verify schema and datatypes.
- This should match typical academic big data requirements.

4. Train multiple models, not just one
- Train 3 to 4 suitable models so that we can compare. For example Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Tree if using Spark ML, or equivalent classifiers in Mahout.
- Choose models that are practical to run on this kind of tabular medical or wearable data.
- Do basic hyperparameter tuning to reach reasonable accuracy or F1 score.

5. Evaluation and comparison
- Give accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
- Provide a confusion matrix for the best models.
- Short note on which features seem most useful is appreciated.

6. Step by step run instructions
- We are new to tools like Spark and Mahout. So please provide a clear step by step guide on how to run the scripts or commands.
- This should include how to place the file in HDFS, how to create the Hive table, how to run the model training script, and how to view the results.
- A short README is enough, but it should be detailed.

What I will provide
- The already cleaned and merged dataset as CSV.
- The current preprocessing notebook or script so that you can see how the columns were created.

Requirements for the freelancer
- Hands on experience with Hadoop ecosystem such as HDFS, Hive and either Spark ML or Mahout.
- Comfortable with real world health or wearable datasets where data can be messy and incomplete.
- Able to define a target from the data and not rely only on pre labelled public datasets.
- Able to explain the steps so that we can reproduce them in our lab environment.",CDD,SAS

Price can be negotiated depending on what you provide

I need an automated reporting system that updates in real time and gives me accurate, validated lead data for my Meta advertising campaigns.

I run all lead generation through Perspective funnels, so the system must:

Automatically pull Important Meta Ads data (spend, clicks, CPM, CPL, Meta-reported leads) using Supermetrics or a similar connector.

Break down performance by Campaign → Ad Set → Ad, so I can clearly see where money is being spent and which assets are performing.

Automatically pull real validated leads from Perspective into Google Sheets.

Match real leads back to specific ads using timestamps or UTMs.

Calculate True CPL daily:
True CPL = Amount Spent ÷ Real Leads

Display a daily dashboard showing spend, real leads, and true CPL, with alerts when CPL approaches my lead price.

Generate an automatic weekly billing summary based on:
(Real Leads × Lead Price) – Weekly Ad Spend

Store all data historically and keep everything updating automatically.

The final result should give me accurate, real-time tracking, full visibility across campaigns/adsets/ads",CDD,Marketing Analytics

Excel Expert Needed: Build an inventory dashboard,Iceland,Posted last week,2025-11-24T13:52:39.700Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Excel-Expert-Needed-Build-inventory-dashboard_~021992954519610072298/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"I run a wholesale aggregation business acting as an intermediary between small suppliers and a large retail chain. I manage the inventory for the retailer (Vendor Managed Inventory).

The Problem:
Currently, my workflow relies on manual VLOOKUPs, row-counting, and checking across multiple disconnected spreadsheets. This is error-prone and unscalable. The retailer frequently updates their assortment list (adding/deleting rows), which breaks my current manual formulas.

The Goal:
I need an Excel Expert to build a robust, ""low-code"" dashboard that consolidates data from multiple sources to automate my weekly ordering and audit my data quality. I need a ""set and forget"" system where I drop raw files into a folder, click ""Refresh,"" and see exactly what I need to order.

The Solution:
I need a dashboard built using Excel Power Query (Get & Transform) and Data Models/Pivot Tables. I do not want complex VBA macros or Python scripts that I cannot maintain.

*Detailed Scope of Work*

A. The Data Inputs (Source Files)

The system must ingest these 4 distinct Excel files from a specific folder structure:
- File A (Store Assortment): The retailer’s template (EAN, Article #, Retail Price). Note: The retailer frequently adds/deletes rows.
- File B (Stock Report): Weekly data dump (EAN, Current Stock Qty).
- File C (Sales History): Monthly sales data columns (Jan 22, Feb 22, etc.) mapped by EAN.
- File D (Internal Master): My internal file mapping EANs to Supplier Name, Cost Price, and Status.

B. The Data Transformation (Power Query Requirements)

Merge Strategy: Merge all files based on the EAN/Barcode key.

Robustness: The system must handle ""Full Outer Joins.""
- If an item is in my list but missing from the Stock Report, it must flag as ""MISSING DATA"" (not break).
- If an item is in the Store Assortment but not in my Master List, it must flag as ""NEW LISTING.""

Calculations: Calculate ""Average Weekly Sales"" dynamically based on the selected period.

C. The Dashboard Interface (The ""Cockpit"" Tab)

I need a single ""Dashboard"" sheet that contains:

Slicers:
- Supplier Slicer: To filter the view for one specific supplier (I create one PO per supplier).
- Status Slicer: To filter for ""Active"" or ""Discontinued"" items.
- Timeline: A visual timeline to select the sales history period (e.g., Select ""Jan-March 2023"" to use as a baseline for forecasting).

The Pivot Table:
- Rows: Product Name / EAN.
- Values: Sum of Sales (Dynamic based on Timeline), Current Stock.

Ordering Logic (Formula):
- A calculation visible next to the pivot table: IF(Stock  (AvgSales * LeadTime + Buffer), ""ORDER"", ""OK"").

D. The Audit Tab

A separate view to highlight errors:
- Price Check: Highlight rows where Retailer Price ≠ My Internal Price.
- Assortment Sync: List items that exist in the Retailer file but are missing from the Stock file.",CDD,Data Analysis

We are a growing business running paid media campaigns on Facebook/Meta Ads that drive traffic to specific landing pages. Our primary goal is to establish reliable, end-to-end conversion tracking and visualization to accurately measure campaign performance, identify bottlenecks, and scale successful ads.
Crucially, the initial Facebook Pixel/CAPI and GA4 setups have been completed. We now need an expert to audit, validate, and optimize the existing tracking to ensure data accuracy and then build a comprehensive analysis dashboard.

🛠️ Key Responsibilities & Deliverables
The successful freelancer will be responsible for the following technical deliverables:
1. Tracking Audit & Validation
Facebook Pixel & CAPI Audit: Conduct a full technical audit of the current Facebook Pixel and Conversions API (CAPI) implementation (server-side, if applicable).
Deduplication Check: Verify that event deduplication is working perfectly to prevent over-reporting in Ads Manager.
Parameter Verification: Confirm that key data parameters (e.g., value, currency, user data) are being passed correctly and securely.
GA4 Data Validation: Audit the current Google Analytics 4 (GA4) event configuration.
UTM Strategy Optimization: Review and refine the existing UTM Tagging strategy used in Facebook Ads to ensure granular data (Campaign, Ad Set, Ad Name) is populating correctly in GA4 reports.
Data Consistency: Identify and troubleshoot any discrepancies between Facebook Ads Manager reported conversions and GA4 attributed conversions.
2. Full-Funnel Dashboard Creation (Looker Studio)
Data Sources: Build a comprehensive dashboard, preferably using Looker Studio (Google Data Studio), connecting data from both:
Facebook Ads (via a suitable connector like Supermetrics, Funnel, etc.)
Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
Full-Funnel Visualization: Define and visualize the core funnel steps clearly (e.g., Ad Impressions $\rightarrow$ Ad Click $\rightarrow$ Landing Page View $\rightarrow$ Key Lead/Sales Event).
Bottleneck Analysis: The dashboard must clearly display drop-off rates (in %) at every stage of the funnel to immediately flag broken steps or high-friction areas.
Segmentation: Allow filtering and segmentation by Campaign, Ad Set, Ad, and Landing Page to identify top and bottom performers.

✅ Required Skills & Expertise
We are looking for candidates who demonstrate mastery in:
Audit & Debugging: Proven experience in debugging and validating existing Facebook Conversions API (CAPI) and GA4 implementations.
Analytics Mastery: Expert proficiency in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google Tag Manager (GTM).
Data Visualization: Strong portfolio demonstrating custom dashboard creation using Looker Studio (preferred) or Tableau/Power BI.
Data Blending: Ability to seamlessly blend and reconcile data from disparate sources (Facebook Ads and GA4).
Attention to Detail: Meticulous approach to defining and implementing precise UTM tagging conventions.",CDD,Data Analysis

The goal is to develop a working Python prototype that automatically processes multiple NOAA climate datasets and combines them into a single trend indicator showing how key global climate variables have changed over time.

The project will focus on aligning several long-term datasets—air temperature, sea surface temperature, precipitation, and tropical storm activity—comparing each to a modern baseline period, and generating a single composite time series.

Deliverables:

-  Retrieve and process four core NOAA datasets (air temperature, sea surface temperature, precipitation, tropical storms).

- Align all datasets to a common time window (1979 to 2025).

- Use the 1991 to 2020 period as the “normal” baseline for comparison.

- Calculate how much each year (1979 to 2025) differs from the average during 1991 to 2020 for each variable.

- Standardize these differences so all variables are on the same numerical scale (e.g., z-scores).

- Combine all standardized variables using equal weighting to produce a single composite index.

- Output a time-series dataset and a simple line chart showing how the index changes from 1979 to 2025.

- Provide a fully commented Jupyter notebook or Python script that reproduces the results step-by-step.

Build a 5-Year Monthly Cash-Flow Forecast Model (Excel + Power Query + Scenario Engine),Panama,Posted 5 days ago,2025-11-27T09:58:15.895Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Build-Year-Monthly-Cash-Flow-Forecast-Model-Excel-Power-Query-Scenario-Engine_~021993982695305928917/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"Build a 5-Year Monthly Cash-Flow Forecast Model (Excel + Power Query + Scenario Engine) — Uses My Existing Source Files**


Build a 5-Year Monthly Cash-Flow Forecast Model (Excel + Power Query + Scenario Engine) — Uses My Existing Source Files

Project Overview
We are seeking an experienced financial modeler to build a 5-year, monthly cash-flow forecasting engine in Excel, integrating and populating the model using our existing data from three Excel source files:
1.	Historical monthly cash-flow actuals (Direct Method)
2.	Annual 12-month operating budget
3.	Long-term business case (multi-year P&L drivers, FTE schedules, capex plan, debt amortization, DSCR rules, etc.)
The consultant must build the solution and pull in the actual numerical data from these three files to fully populate the model.
This is a hands-on modeling and integration assignment, not just a template setup.
The final deliverable is a clean, stable, Power-Query-driven forecasting engine with hybrid logic (Direct + Indirect), scenario management (Base, Upside, Downside, Stress), and professional formatting.

Scope of Work
1. Build a Structured Forecasting Workbook
Develop a CFO-grade Excel model with the following tabs:
•	CONFIG (model start date, horizon, scenario selector)
•	SCENARIOS (override assumptions for the four cases)
•	ASSUMPTIONS_ST (short-term drivers for months 1–36)
•	ASSUMPTIONS_LT (long-term drivers for years 4–5)
•	ACTUALS (direct cash-flow history)
•	CALC_FORECAST (hybrid forecasting engine)
•	OUTPUT_CF (final monthly cash-flow statement)
The layout must be clean, organized, and intuitive.

2. Data Integration — Using the Three Source Files We Provide
You will receive three Excel workbooks. You are expected to:
•	Build Power Query connections into each file
•	Import required tables (actuals, budget, business-case drivers)
•	Map the data into the appropriate assumption tabs
•	Normalize and stage the data where needed
•	Populate the forecast engine using our real inputs
This is not a theoretical model.
This is a fully populated forecast using our existing projections and actuals.

3. Forecasting Logic (Hybrid Method)
Build the full calculation chain, including:
•	Indirect CFO logic
•	Direct method for actuals
•	Automatic Actual vs Forecast month switching
•	Working capital roll-forward
•	Capex + depreciation roll-forward
•	Loan amortization, interest schedules, and DSCR rules
•	Scenario overrides (revenue, opex, collections days, capex, interest rate shocks)

4. Scenario Analysis
Model must support:
•	Base
•	Upside
•	Downside
•	Stress
Scenario adjustments must flow through the entire forecast.

5. Final Deliverables
•	Fully working Excel workbook
•	All Power Query connections active and refreshable
•	Forecast fully populated using our real numbers
•	Clean formatting and professional structure
•	No circular references
•	Light documentation + optional Loom walkthrough

Candidate Requirements
Required Skills
•	Advanced Excel financial modeling (5+ years)
•	Power Query (Get & Transform) — expert level
•	Ability to harmonize multiple external data sources
•	Strong FP&A, corporate finance, cash-flow modeling experience
Preferred Background
•	FP&A, CFO services, investment banking, valuation
•	Experience with multi-year business cases
•	Familiarity with debt schedules & DSCR reporting
Portfolio Requirements
Applicants must provide:
•	At least one Excel model sample
•	An example of Power Query integration
•	An example of a scenario-based model (if available)
Applications without samples will not be reviewed.

Budget & Timeline
•	USD $200–$300 total
•	5–7 days turnaround

How to Apply — Screening Questions
Please answer the following:
1.	How would you structure a multi-source forecasting model using three separate Excel files?
2.	What steps will you take to ensure links will not break over time?
3.	Provide a sample Excel model you built (non-confidential).
4.	Provide an example Power Query integration you’ve done.
5.	Describe your experience building scenario-based forecasting models.

Fix time series chart hierarchy in Power BI,United States,Posted 2 weeks ago,2025-11-20T17:04:12.284Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Fix-time-series-chart-hierarchy-Power_~021991553171389318742/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"In the attached .pbix file there are two time series charts, the first one works fine, the second does not. You need to fix the second one. The charts show balances of loans at the end of either a quarter or a year. Both charts show the same data, so you can use the first chart to confirm that the second chart works fine once you fix it.

The difference between the first and the second charts is that the first one shows data quarterly (YYYY-QQ) and the second one uses a hierarchy where the user can see the data at the year level, or at the quarter level.

The second chart works fine only at the quarter level. When it's summarized at year level, instead of showing the last value of that year it shows the summation of the quarters. I need to show the last value of that year, for example 2025-Q2 is the last quarter in the data, so 2025 should show the same value as 2025-Q2.

The hierarchy uses a Dates table that contains all the days between 1900 and 2100. In addition, there's a Process Dates table that is used to filter the data shown on the chart. The Process Dates table has the quarters available in the data.

There's a slicer with ""Last number of years"". These are the number of years shown on the chart, ending on the last quarter available.

There are two lines in the chart, a blue line for a bank with Own_Bank = 1, and the second line with the median of the other banks where Own_Bank = 0.

Last, the charts show Year-over-Year data, that means that they show the balance of the year minus the balance of the previous year. In the case of Own_Bank = 0 it will show the median of the year minus the median of the previous year. Again, check against the first chart that works fine.",CDD,Microsoft Power BI

Project spec

We require a list of all ‘independent estate agents’ from FOUR counties within England.  

These counties are :
West Yorkshire, 
Devon, 
Derbyshire, 
Nottinghamshire.

The project will consist of 2 parts as follows-

Part 1 - First within each county we need to extract a list of all towns and cities - using chatgpt. (The reason we need this is because search by chatgpt at county level is too diverse and does not generate sufficient data for us, hence we need to operate at town and city level to get all the agents.

For this you can simply type the script ‘can you provide me with a simplified list of all town and cities in the county of (county name) or whatever you feel is appropriate. 

Part 2 - Then for each of these town and cities get the listings of all 'independent' estate agents with all the information needed. Chatgpt will do this very effectively. Or you can use what ever other means you have. But MOST IMPORTANT – the agents must be 'independent’ - we DO NOT require nations chains, or franchises. 

The script we suggest for chatpgpt is :
‘Please provide a list of all independent estate agents within 'town or city' and exclude all national chains and franchises. Include the agent name, address, post code, telephone number and email address and their specialism’.

Please put this in (alphabetic order – agent name) in a google sheet with correct headings (ie Agent, address, post code, tel number, email, specialism)

All information must be supplied in googlesheets excel for clear understanding with correct headings for agent name, address, post code, Tel number and specialism.

We are an Australian construction company seeking an experienced consultant to design and develop a complete system for accurate monthly cashflow forecasting. This system must be based on the project schedule created in Microsoft Project and must allow our Project Managers to easily forecast both project costs and project revenue.

The purpose of this engagement is to create a set of templates, tools, and step-by-step Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that allow our Project Managers to reliably produce accurate cashflow forecasts with minimal manual effort.

Scope of Work

Include monthly forecast cost curve, forecast revenue curve, cumulative values, and gross margin curve.

Allow for easy adjustment of variations, changes in scope, and revised contract sums.

Ensure no manual formulas need to be changed by Project Managers.

3. Reporting Dashboard

A simple, clean set of cashflow graphs suitable for monthly reporting to executives and finance.

Dashboard must automatically update when new MS Project exports are pasted in.

How Project Managers should cost-load a schedule.

How to export time-phased data from MS Project.

How to paste data into the Excel template.

How to interpret the cashflow outputs and prepare a monthly cashflow forecast.

The SOPs must be extremely clear, visual, easy to follow, and written for construction Project Managers who are not technical Excel users.

Test the system using sample project data.

Demonstrate that the template calculates correctly when programme dates shift.

Make refinements based on feedback until the workflow is smooth and reliable.

Deliverables

Fully configured MS Project cost and revenue loading structure.

Automated Excel cashflow template (or Power BI dashboard if recommended).

Complete SOPs for Project Managers in PDF and Word formats.

One live demonstration session to hand over the system and answer questions.

Automation for Virtual Color Analysis Reports,United States,Posted 2 weeks ago,2025-11-18T19:29:00.648Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Automation-for-Virtual-Color-span-class-highlight-Analysis-span-Reports_~021990864836782098006/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"My name is Paige and I offer a service called ""The Color Girl"" Miami,

I'm looking for a skilled freelancer to automate the creation of ""virtual color analysis"" reports. 

WHAT WE DO AND WHAT IS COLOR ANALYSIS?:
- Overall, we help women / men feel more beautiful by telling them the colors that most compliment their skin tones.
- We do this by analyzing hair color, contrast levels, eye color, vein color, freckles, and overall complexion. 
- Once we do the analyzation, we give the person a ""season"" which they fall into.. There are 12 seasons in color analysis. You can be a soft autumn, true winter, etc... Just look it up. The 12 season system. We have 12 canva templates. One for each season. 

For context: We have done this analysis session strictly in-person, but have recently pivoted to doing it virtually.

After someone purchases the virtual analysis, we automatically send them an intake form where they submit all of their necessary information and pictures.

Once we receive the intake form with all of the information, we would like the automation to decide what season the person is. Grok does this well if you submit the PDF of all of the information + pictures..

As mentioned, we have 12 templates for each season. Once the season is found, we need the persons photos and information uploaded in the necessary template.

Here is an example of our templates and a finished PDF:

TEMPLATE 1- https://www.canva.com/design/DAG3HSr2qAk/FQxGP5QzBd2SzH4MSCZWGA/edit?utm_content=DAG3HSr2qAk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton

TEMPLATE 2 (dark autumn example)- https://www.canva.com/design/DAG2YMKRXZc/H7ng3es4LD9FaIygHcgsEA/edit?utm_content=DAG2YMKRXZc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton

Finished PDF - https://www.canva.com/design/DAG4ROU22MM/EMeuMbl2vO2KJU9IHjRKJw/edit?utm_content=DAG4ROU22MM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton

In the finished PDF, you may notice there are also makeup recommendations. We have certain templates for those as well... Depending on the season the person falls into, the automation can add those templates as well. 

Our color analyst Paige will get the final sign off on the PDF to make sure the season and information is correct... And then once approved, Paige's assistant will email it to the person who purchased.

ALONG WITH THIS, we need a 2nd simple automation setup which does the following:
- Tracks purchases of the virtual analysis reports
- Tracks if the purchase who purchased submitted the intake form
- Track if the automation successfully completed the analysis
- Tracks if Paige approved
- Tracks if the PDF was sent out.

The total budget for this product is $300.",CDD,Automation

Senior GCP Data Engineer (Python + BigQuery + Presidio + Vertex AI) for Chatbot Analytics,USA,Posted 2 weeks ago,2025-11-19T07:02:41.202Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Senior-GCP-span-class-highlight-Data-span-Engineer-Python-BigQuery-Presidio-Vertex-for-Chatbot-Analytics_~021991039406678778494/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"QUICK SUMMARY
We run a legal-information chatbot for domestic violence survivors and need a senior Google Cloud plus Python data engineer to build a secure, PII-aware data pipeline from raw text transcripts to anonymized text, then into BigQuery metrics, and finally a basic dashboard for grants.

This is primarily a data engineering and ETL role, with light analytics on top using BigQuery SQL and Looker Studio.

MUST-HAVE SKILLS (IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE)

Please only apply if you are strong in all of these:

1. Google Cloud Platform – BigQuery, GCS, IAM (senior level)
   - Designing and populating BigQuery tables for analytics
   - Loading data into BigQuery from Python
   - Designing GCS buckets, prefixes, lifecycle rules
   - Creating and using service accounts with least-privilege IAM

2. Python ETL and data pipelines (senior level)
   - Parsing semi-structured text files into structured records
   - Building small, reliable pipelines with logging, error handling, and configuration files
   - Comfortable working on a secure Mac environment (local scripts calling GCP)

3. PII detection and anonymization (strong experience)
   - Hands-on with Microsoft Presidio or similar tools
   - Combining regular expressions and NER to mask names, phone, email, addresses, case numbers, and similar data
   - Understands how to keep city, state, age and resource names while removing direct identifiers

4. LLM JSON extraction (Vertex AI preferred)
   - Calling an LLM from Python, ideally Vertex AI
   - Designing prompts that return strict JSON according to a known schema
   - Handling invalid JSON, retries, and logging failures safely

5. BigQuery SQL and basic BI (intermediate–senior)
   - Writing queries for monthly summaries and KPI tables
   - Understanding fact vs summary tables
   - Comfortable wiring BigQuery into a simple Looker Studio dashboard (we don’t need fancy design—just clear numbers and charts)

Nice-to-have:
- Looker Studio experience beyond basics
- Streamlit or Hex dashboards (for possible future phase)
- Work with sensitive domains (healthcare, legal, DV, mental health)

PROJECT OVERVIEW

We have:
- About 18 months of chatbot transcripts, roughly 500 conversations per month. Some conversations are very long, up to 100+ pages.
- A detailed technical spec (v1.1) describing the architecture.
- A 59-metric dictionary for what we want to extract.

You will implement a v1 pipeline:
- Secure Mac environment (Python + Presidio)
- -GCS buckets (raw, clean, metrics-json)
- -Vertex AI (one call per conversation)
- -BigQuery (conversations fact table + monthly_summary)
- -Looker Studio dashboard connected to those tables

The architecture is mostly defined, but we are open to your expert suggestions if they lower complexity, cost, or risk.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND DELIVERABLES

A. GCP Setup

- Create and configure GCS buckets, for example:
  - raw (raw .txt with PII, 90-day retention)
  - clean (anonymized conversations)
  - metrics-json (per-conversation metrics JSON)
- Create BigQuery dataset (for example, “statutefinder”) with:
  - conversations table (per conversation)
  - optional messages table (per message)
  - monthly_summary table or view
- Set up service accounts and IAM roles following least-privilege principles.

B. Script 1 – upload_to_gcs.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Upload local .txt transcript exports to path like:
  gs://raw-bucket/YYYYMMDD/filename.txt
- Log which files were uploaded and where.

C. Script 2 – anonymize_and_parse.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Read raw transcripts from GCS or local storage (pattern to be agreed).
- Split into individual conversations using the known delimiter line “CONVERSATION #” plus the header block.
- Parse and preserve header fields: ID, DATE, LOCATION, MODEL.
- Apply regular expressions and Presidio to redact PII in the conversation body:
  - survivor, abuser, and children names
  - phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, case/docket numbers, etc.
  - keep city, state, country, ages, and clearly “resource” organization names (courts, shelters)
- Write sanitized conversations back to the clean bucket as .txt or .json files.
- Nice-to-have: produce a CSV listing detected entities per conversation for human review.
- Important: reuse or extend our existing Presidio anonymizer from our GitHub organization (we will share the repo).

D. Script 3 – extract_metrics_to_bq.py

- Read anonymized conversations from clean bucket.
- Compute structural metrics such as message counts, word counts, abandoned conversations, etc.
- For each conversation, call Vertex AI once with an external prompt file to extract:
  - legal topics, abuse types, statutes mentioned
  - booleans such as protection order discussed, safety plan delivered, shelter guidance provided, emergency referral suggested
  - primary language
- Enforce valid JSON output and implement minimal retry with logging when the model returns malformed JSON.
- Write combined metrics JSON to metrics-json bucket.
- Load rows into BigQuery conversations table, including:
  - conversation_id, date/time, location fields, structural metrics, LLM metrics
  - batch_id, processed_at, metrics_prompt_version
- Ensure idempotency so the same conversation_id is not inserted twice.

E. Aggregations and Dashboard Hook

- Write BigQuery SQL to create or refresh monthly_summary from conversations.
- Optionally configure a scheduled query (for example, monthly).
- Help connect BigQuery to Looker Studio and build a simple v1 dashboard page:
  - headline metrics
  - topic breakdown
  - map by state
  Clarity matters more than design polish.

F. Documentation

- README.md with setup and run instructions for Scripts 1–3.
- SECURITY.md summarizing buckets, IAM, lifecycle rules, anonymization flow (high-level).
- METRICS_GUIDE.md explaining how stored/derived fields map to the 59-metric dictionary (we provide the sheet).
- requirements.txt listing Python dependencies (Presidio, Google Cloud client libraries, Vertex AI SDK, etc.).

CONSTRAINTS AND PRACTICAL NOTES

- Data volume: about 500 conversations per month; some conversations are very long.
- Budget: around 500 USD fixed price for this v1 scope.
- Timeline: target 3–4 weeks.
- The secure anonymization environment is a dedicated, encrypted Mac controlled by us.

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- We export a new text transcript batch on the Mac.
- We run your scripts or trigger the flow.
- New rows appear in conversations; monthly_summary is updated.
- The Looker Studio dashboard refreshes and shows the new month’s numbers.
- We do not re-run the LLM on older conversations.
- Raw PII only lives in the raw bucket and is auto-deleted after its retention period.

HOW TO APPLY

Start your proposal with the word “METRICS” so we know you read this.

In 4–6 short paragraphs, please answer:

1. GCP and BigQuery example – describe one project where you built a pipeline using GCS and BigQuery. What was your role, and what did the pipeline do?
2. PII and Presidio experience – have you used Microsoft Presidio or similar tools? In what context, and what kinds of PII did you anonymize?
3. LLM JSON extraction – describe one project where you called an LLM from Python and enforced strict JSON outputs. How did you handle invalid JSON or failures?
4. BigQuery and dashboards – briefly describe your experience preparing data for dashboards such as Looker Studio or similar tools.

If you do not have hands-on experience with GCP, Python ETL, PII anonymization, and LLM JSON extraction, this project is not a fit.",CDD,Data Engineering

Project Description:
I am looking for an experienced biostatistician, or data scientist with strong expertise in clinical trial analytics, network meta-analysis, and R programming to help me perform a Bayesian network meta-analysis of glioblastoma (GBM) immunotherapy trials.
I already collected a large dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov (exported to Excel), but I need a professional who can:
What I Need From You
1. Validate & Repair the Dataset
Review the Excel file I have extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov.
Identify missing, inconsistent, or unusable data.
If necessary, re-collect missing outcomes or correct entries using publicly available sources (ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, trial registries, published manuscripts, conference abstracts, etc.).
Ensure all data is peer-reviewed-eligible, accurate, and reproducible.

2. Prepare an Analysis-Ready Dataset:

Structure the dataset properly for meta-analysis:
Treatment arms (intervention, comparator, combination therapies)
Study design, phase, enrollment
Outcomes (OS, PFS, ORR, DCR, MTD, toxicity, etc.)
Biomarker information if available (MGMT, IDH, PD-L1, TILs, etc.)
Consolidated codebook / definitions
Final cleaned CSV/Excel files ready for publication and analysis

3. Conduct a Full Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis (NMA)
Using R (preferred packages: gemtc, BUGSnet, rjags, or netmeta):
Build the treatment network (nodes = therapies, edges = comparisons)
Compute pooled effect sizes (HRs, ORs, RRs depending on data availability)
Assess heterogeneity, consistency, model fit
Run sensitivity analyses
Rank treatments using SUCRA or equivalent
Therapies of interest include (but are not limited to):
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)
Dendritic cell vaccines
Peptide vaccines
CAR-T
Oncolytic viruses
Combination therapies (e.g., pembrolizumab + TMZ or pembrolizumab + olaparib)

4. Provide High-Quality Visualizations
You will generate publication-ready figures:
Network plot
Forest plots (OS, PFS, ORR, etc.)
SUCRA ranking plots
Funnel plots if applicable
Subgroup plots (if biomarker data is available)
These must meet the standards of peer-reviewed oncology journals.

5. Deliver All Code + Documentation
You will provide:
✔ All R scripts used for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization
✔ Fully commented code so I can reproduce the analysis
✔ A clear explanation of methods, assumptions, limitations
✔ A summary report that I can use when writing the manuscript

6. Guidance for Publication
This project directly supports a manuscript intended for submission to a peer-reviewed oncology journal. You will:
Ensure the analysis follows current PRISMA-NMA guidelines
Ensure the data sources are properly documented
Provide statistical interpretation I can use in my paper
Required Skills
Please only apply if you have strong experience in:
Bayesian network meta-analysis
R programming (advanced)
Biostatistics and clinical trial methodology
Oncology/Immunotherapy data (preferred)
Systematic reviews and evidence synthesis
Preparing publication-quality figures
Deliverables
Cleaned, validated, analysis-ready dataset (Excel/CSV)

I am working on an MBA research project focused on factors influencing expansion decisions of foreign investors in Kuwait.
My study examines three variables:

Government incentives

Ease of procedures

Market potential
And one outcome variable:

Expansion decision

I already have:

The full questionnaire

A draft research report

Clear methodology (quantitative, Likert scale, regression)

I am looking for a freelancer to help me with research-support tasks, including simulating a dataset, running the appropriate statistical tests, and helping me refine the analysis sections of the report.

This work is for learning, practice, and methodology testing — I take full responsibility for completing and submitting my own academic work.

Scope of Work 
1. Simulated Dataset Creation (60–80 Cases)

You will create a simulated dataset based on the questionnaire I provide.
The dataset must reflect realistic patterns that could appear among foreign investors operating in Kuwait.

Notes:

This is NOT real human data collection.

It is used to practice analysis methods and test the statistical model.

You may use AI, but you must review and adjust the data to ensure it looks realistic and varied.

Deliverable:

Clean Excel/Google Sheets file with all variables coded (1–5 Likert scale).

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Check for missing fields

Encode Likert-scale responses

Prepare dataset for statistical testing

3. Statistical Analysis (Required for My Methodology Practice)

Run the following analyses on the simulated dataset:

A. Descriptive statistics

Means

Standard deviations

Basic frequencies

B. Reliability testing (Cronbach’s alpha)

For each construct.

C. Correlation matrix
D. Multiple regression analysis

(Model: 3 IVs → 1 DV)

Deliver:

Coefficients, p-values, t-stats

R & R²

Interpretation of results

This is allowed because the data is simulated and the analysis is for educational and methodological purposes.

4. Research Report Support (Editing, Not Writing From Scratch)

This part must comply with Upwork policies.
The freelancer must NOT write academic assignments for me, but CAN:

Help improve clarity of the methodology section

Help reorganize missing sections (sampling frame, instrument development, limitations)

Help refine statistical results based on the analysis

Help rewrite unclear sentences in my existing text

Help me ensure consistency between questionnaire, variables, and analysis

Freelancer cannot:

Write the full report for me

Create original academic content intended for direct submission

Complete graded academic tasks on my behalf

They can:

Edit, guide, and refine my content

Provide analysis results

Suggest structure

Ensure technical accuracy of statistical interpretations

I will always be the one writing and submitting the final academic work.

If you have a strong attention to detail and a passion for data extraction, we would love to hear from you!

Project Type: One-time project (with potential for future enhancements)
Skills Required: Python, Web Scraping, BeautifulSoup / Selenium / Scrapy, Data Parsing, CSV generation, API integration (optional), Real Estate data familiarity

⸻

Project Overview

I’m looking for a developer who can build a Python-based web scraper that collects all current MLS real estate listings from a specified region or MLS-accessible website and compiles the data into a clean, structured CSV file.

This script will be run manually from a test environment (local machine or cloud VM). It doesn’t need to be deployed as a production system—just a reliable script that outputs complete listing data on demand.

⸻

What the Script Should Do
	•	Scrape all active / current MLS listings from the target source.
	•	Collect all key data fields from each listing, including but not limited to:
	•	Listing address
	•	Listing description
	•	Days on Market (DOM)
	•	Number of units (if multi-family)
	•	Lot size
	•	Building square footage
	•	Beds & baths
	•	Year built
	•	Listing price
	•	Property type
	•	Any agent/office fields
	•	Any additional structured data included on the listing page
	•	Save all results into a CSV file with one row per property.

⸻

Technical Requirements
	•	Script must be written in Python.
	•	Use a reputable scraping framework such as:
	•	Scrapy
	•	BeautifulSoup + Requests
	•	Selenium (only if necessary for dynamic content)
	•	Output format must be a CSV with consistent column headings.
	•	Code should be well-structured, commented, and easy for a non-developer to run (e.g., python scraper.py).
	•	Script should gracefully handle pagination, rate limits, dynamic content, and errors.
	•	Should include a configuration section for:
	•	Target URL(s)
	•	Any login credentials or tokens, if applicable
	•	File output name

⸻

Important Notes
	•	Developer must ensure scraping follows terms of service, uses allowed endpoints, or utilizes any available APIs.
If certain MLS data cannot legally be scraped, I’m open to:
	•	API-based retrieval
	•	RETS/RESO Web API integration
	•	A hybrid approach

(Please mention your familiarity with MLS data access.)

⸻

What You Should Include in Your Proposal
	•	Past experience with web scraping (especially real estate data is a big plus).
	•	Your preferred scraping framework and why.
	•	Estimated timeline for delivering:
	•	First working prototype
	•	Final polished script
	•	Any assumptions or data access requirements you foresee.

⸻

Deliverables
	1.	Fully functional Python scraper script.
	2.	Clean CSV output containing all listing fields.
	3.	Brief readme or usage notes on how to run the script.
	4.	Optional: virtual environment or requirements.txt file.",CDD,Data Scraping

You must:

- Merge all duplicate companies that own multiple different games
- Look deeper than the app publisher name
- Identify the real operational company or the brand’s parent organization
- Verify the company via website, licensing pages, app privacy policy, or corporate disclosures

Avoid including generic mobile game companies that are not casino, sports betting, or real-money gaming operators 

For example:

An app may show “XYZ Mobile Ltd” as the developer, but the real operator might be “BetKing Group” or “Hero Gaming Ltd.”

Many white-label or turnkey platform providers publish apps on behalf of casino operators — these must be categorized correctly.",CDD,Data Scraping

I need a detail-obsessed person to fix this by comparing the original applicant data to what appears on the website and correcting it.

This is urgent. I want someone who can start immediately and work efficiently without hand-holding.

What You’ll Be Doing

You will be given:

An Excel/Google Sheets file with all applicant data (household composition, city, county, wishlist, etc.)

The existing “Adopt-a-Family” listings on my website (each family has a Family ID and a gift/adoption box)

The AI prompt/code I use to generate the public story and formatted output

Your job is to:

Compare & Verify Each Family Listing

Match each Family ID on the website to the corresponding row in the spreadsheet.

Check every key field:

City

County

Household size

Adults & children in the home

Wishlist items

Flag and correct any mismatch or invented data (e.g., AI added an adult male that doesn’t exist, added wrong wishlist items, wrong city or county, etc.).

Correct & Rewrite Where Needed

Where the listing is wrong, you will:

Fix the structured data so it matches the spreadsheet.

Use the provided AI prompt/code to regenerate the family story / description, making sure:

Names are properly anonymized.

The story reflects the essence of what the applicant actually wrote.

Grammar and clarity are clean and professional.

If AI output is slightly off, you must edit it manually so it stays faithful to the real data.

Buy or Build Large List of US Business Owners (Age 60–90) With $10M+ EBITDA Businesses,United States,Posted 5 days ago,2025-11-27T02:35:36.751Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Buy-Build-Large-List-Business-Owners-Age-With-10M-EBITDA-Businesses_~021993871298285902253/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"I am working on an educational research project and need help buying or gathering a large dataset of U.S. business owners age 60–90 who own companies that can reasonably be estimated to generate $10M+ in annual EBITDA.

Because private companies rarely publish EBITDA, it is expected and acceptable to approximate this using revenue ranges + typical industry margins.

There are two types of freelancers who can help:

1) You ALREADY HAVE a relevant dataset

If you have previously exported large U.S. owner/executive datasets from tools like:

ZoomInfo

Apollo

PitchBook

PrivCo

BoardEx

LinkedIn scraping

…please tell me immediately.
Even if the data isn’t perfect, volume matters, and we may be able to use it.

2) You can BUILD or EXPAND a dataset

If you don’t already have a dataset but have strong ZoomInfo/Apollo experience, you may propose a method for gathering or expanding the list efficiently.

The goal is as many qualifying owners as possible, not just a small sample.

Target Owner Profile

Age: 60–90

Owner Location: U.S. (city & state preferred)

Company HQ: U.S. (city & state required)

Size: Companies likely producing $10M+ EBITDA, inferred using:

Revenue ranges (ex: $50M, $100M, $200M+)

Employee headcount

Industry EBITDA margin norms

Ownership: Preferably founder-owned, family-owned, or owner-operator

Industry: Open to all

Requested Data Fields (as many as possible)

Owner full name

Estimated age / age bracket

Owner city + state (if available)

Company name

Company HQ city + state

Industry / sector

Revenue estimate (from ZoomInfo/Apollo or other tools)

Employee count

Your estimated EBITDA band (based on revenue × typical margin)

Company website

Owner LinkedIn

Company LinkedIn

Best available contact email / phone

Source(s) used

Perfection is not required — volume + reasonable accuracy is what matters most.

Deliverables Format (Required)

You must deliver the dataset in both formats:

CSV file

XLSX (Excel) file

Each file should include all fields available and maintain consistent column headers.

When Applying, Please Specify:
A) If you already have a dataset:

How many total rows you have

Columns included

Data sources used

Industries or sectors included

Price for providing it

B) If you can build/expand a dataset:

Tools you will use (ZoomInfo, Apollo, etc.)

How many rows you can deliver

Your EBITDA estimation method

A sample of 5 rows in CSV or Excel

Your best price proposal (budget is limited due to educational nature of the project)

Important Notes

This is an educational research project, so budget is limited

Larger datasets will be prioritized

Strong preference for freelancers experienced with ZoomInfo/Apollo exports

We care about clear data sources, reasonable accuracy, and large volume",CDD,Data Scraping

👥 Relevant Contacts

Priority 1:
•	HR contact / Human Resources Department → main contact (if available)
•	Division Manager / Department Head / Project Manager,
e.g. Project Manager Plumbing, Head of Heating, Construction Manager
•	Application emails such as bewerbungen@
Priority 2
•	Management, if no HR contacts are available
If a company has multiple divisions, all project managers for each division must be entered if available.
________________________________________
Examples

Example 1:
A building technology company offers heating, plumbing, and sheet metal services but has no project managers or other department heads listed on the website:

→ Email: info@… or hr@...... etc.
→ Category: Heating, Plumbing, Sheet Metal

Example 2:
A building technology company offers heating, plumbing, and sheet metal services and has project managers listed on the website:

→ Person 1: Project Manager Heating → Category: Heating
→ Person 2: Project Manager Plumbing → Category: Plumbing
→ Person 3: Project Manager Sheet Metal → Category: Sheet Metal

General Instruction for Finding Emails
Even if project managers are listed on the website, there must always be one contact person for all departments, preferably Human Resources (management level, not administrative staff).

Many companies have special application addresses (e.g., application@...).
→ These must also be found and entered in addition to the HR address if is avaiable
→ Always check the sections “Jobs”, “Career” or job descriptions/PDFs.

If no direct contact is available, a general business email may be used.

Example with HR + Project Managers
A building technology company offers heating, plumbing, and sheet metal services
and has project managers as well as an HR department listed on the website:

• Person 1: Project Manager Heating → Category: Heating
• Person 2: Project Manager Plumbing → Category: Plumbing
• Person 3: Project Manager Sheet Metal → Category: Sheet Metal
• Person 4: HR or Management / info@... → Category: Heating, Plumbing, Sheet Metal
________________________________________
General Instruction for Services

It is not sufficient to enter only “Construction” for a construction company.
As a personnel consultant, I must be able to assign suitable candidates precisely.
For example, if I send a roofer to a road construction company or a road builder to the building construction department, the client will perceive this as spam.

Therefore: every single service must be listed separately.

Example:
A construction company offers the following services:
→ Road construction, building construction, renovation, timber construction, etc.
________________________________________
📊 Format & Structure

• Template will be provided as an Excel file.
• Uniform spelling in all fields.
• No empty fields.
• All email addresses will be verified for validity.
• Excel design will be provided by me.
→ It may be optimized, but the structure must be preserved.
________________________________________
🔎 Quality Standards
•	All companies must be verified
•	Information must match the official website
•	Random quality checks will be performed
•	Revisions will be requested if necessary

We use both Microsoft Power BI and Google Sheets, and the final dashboard should be able to be used in either. 

There should be 4 major components to the dashboard:
1) Outbound orders
2) Inbound orders
3) Fulfilment preparation
4) Demand planning and forecasting

Background: We manufacture and distribute consumer goods, with lot codes and best before dates. We sell both D2C and wholesale. Some orders flow through our IT systems automatically, and are picked, packed, shipped accordingly. Most of our D2C orders fall into this category.

For other orders, that are not automated, we input these manually to an outbound order tracking tab, and then transfer the information to our WMS for our warehouse to pick, pack and ship. To this end, the ""Outbound"" dashboard should have an 'order entry' script or tool, that will enable full order entry. Some of the data will be automated and self-populate, some will be manual. An example would be if it is PRODUCT A, then the weight, dimensions and packing configuration of this product will be constant and automatically inputted, but the quantity and pricing will not. Dates of order and due date for example too, will be manual inputs per instance. 

Once the order is inputted, it would then be transferred to the Outbound tab, and show status (manually adjusted) until it is fully completed, delivered in full. 

Inbound tab should specify what product and/or materials are ordered and inbound (pending) until received by our respective warehouse, and put into inventory for sale/use. 

Fulfilment tab will be for preparation of existing in-stock inventory items to be re-packed, re-assembled, re-bundled, and/or re-configured for on-shipping to a separate fulfilment location. This will be a logistics planning tab, to calculate packing logistics, and what the ultimate transportation requirement will be. 

The forecasting and demand planning tab will take into account the manual customer orders (per the Outbound tab) as well as all sales history that is flowing automatically (e.g. D2C) and create accurate and real-time demand plans to help with forecasting. Inputs should be available to manipulate and modify what upcoming sales pipeline fills are planned, as well as promotional sales periods that are scheduled which should result in a specific multiple of typical sales volume to occur. Inputs for specific lead times per product should also be enabled such that the forecaster can predict when replenishment orders need to be issued. 

We have partial working models of the above either combined or separately, and want someone who can succinctly assist in developing the dashboards and working model in a rapid timeframe, to the specifications sought.",CDD,Food & Beverage

For each domain, provide:

Domain / URL

Where you found it (Telegram, YouTube, Reddit, search, etc.)

Site title or headline (if visible)

1–2 short phrases describing what the site claims to offer

Any obvious operator identifiers shown on the page (for example, usernames or labels used by the service)

Any outbound links (external domains only — no deep crawling)

Category tag (same list as above)

Region relevance (same list as above)

I will handle all WHOIS, hosting, and other technical lookups myself.

📦 DELIVERABLE FORMAT

Please deliver a single CSV with these columns:

type (telegram_channel / domain / youtube / reddit)

name_or_title

This is a simple, structured Data Entry task – all words and images are already in the book.

What you need to do

Create one Anki note per vocabulary item (~5,000 items).

Anki will automatically generate reverse cards (EN → DE), so you only create ONE note per word.

Copy the German word (without article) and English translation from the book.

Add the German word with article, with article color-coded:

der = blue

die = red

das = green

Add one German example sentence (A2–B1 level, can be AI-generated).

Add the English translation of the example.

Add the image from the correct page – use the full page image, not cropped fragments.

Add chapter tags (chapter names from the book) like:
Book::Chapter::01-People, Book::Chapter::02-Body, etc.

Add extra tags (POS, gender).

Image must appear only on the back side of the card.

Important

You don’t need to know German.

Examples may be AI-generated (just keep them correct and natural).

You do NOT create two cards manually. Only one note → Anki creates both directions.

Deliverables

Anki .apkg file with all notes.

The job must be done fully by hand, carefully and accurately.

Your task:

Manually retype all text, dates, amounts, references, descriptions, and balances from this scanned PDF:

Description

Rent

Amount Due

Paid From / Paid To

Inhand / Balance

Bond / Council / Water items

No OCR or tools of any kind. Everything must be typed manually.

After the ledger is recreated in Excel, please do a small sanity check:

Does the total outstanding amount in the ledger seem consistent?

Are there any obvious miscalculations or inconsistencies?
(Just simple observations, no deep accounting analysis required.)

Deliverable:

One clean Excel file with the entire ledger reproduced line-for-line.

One short note (3–5 sentences) with your observations on whether the amounts seem internally consistent.

Data Cleanup & QA for Holiday “Adopt-a-Family” Listings (Excel + Website),United States,Posted 5 days ago,2025-11-27T04:38:55.290Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/span-class-highlight-Data-span-Cleanup-amp-for-Holiday-Adopt-Family-Listings-Excel-Website_~021993902329865017773/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"I run a holiday program called Operation Holiday that matches donors with real families in need through an online “Adopt-a-Family” system.

AI was used to draft the public-facing family stories and gift “adoption boxes,” but there are major errors in some listings (wrong city/county, incorrect household members, extra adults added that don’t exist, wrong wishlists, etc.). I need a detail-obsessed person to fix this by comparing the original applicant data to what appears on the website and correcting it.

This is urgent. I want someone who can start immediately and work efficiently without hand-holding.

What You’ll Be Doing

You will be given:

An Excel/Google Sheets file with all applicant data (household composition, city, county, wishlist, etc.)

The existing “Adopt-a-Family” listings on my website (each family has a Family ID and a gift/adoption box)

The AI prompt/code I use to generate the public story and formatted output

Your job is to:

Compare & Verify Each Family Listing

Match each Family ID on the website to the corresponding row in the spreadsheet.

Check every key field:

City

County

Household size

Adults & children in the home

Wishlist items

Flag and correct any mismatch or invented data (e.g., AI added an adult male that doesn’t exist, added wrong wishlist items, wrong city or county, etc.).

Correct & Rewrite Where Needed

Where the listing is wrong, you will:

Fix the structured data so it matches the spreadsheet.

Use the provided AI prompt/code to regenerate the family story / description, making sure:

Names are properly anonymized.

The story reflects the essence of what the applicant actually wrote.

Grammar and clarity are clean and professional.

If AI output is slightly off, you must edit it manually so it stays faithful to the real data.

Update & Document Changes

Update the website listings (or prepare a clean list of corrected content if I handle the posting).

Maintain a simple change log (e.g., in Excel):

Family ID

What was wrong (short note)

Fix applied

Date/time completed

Requirements

You will be a good fit if you:

Are extremely detail-oriented and get annoyed by sloppy data.

Have strong written English and can edit for clarity and grammar.

Are comfortable working with:

Excel or Google Sheets

A web interface (Shopify or similar product/listing system – experience with Shopify is a plus).

Understand basic AI prompting and can follow a prompt exactly without “freestyling.”

Can handle confidential, sensitive data respectfully. These are real families facing hardship; no screenshots, no sharing, no drama.

Can start immediately and focus on this project over the next 1–2 days.

Scope

Approx. number of families: [insert your current estimate, e.g., 150–200]

Each family has:

A Family ID

A background story from the application

A structured wishlist for each household member

Your job is to ensure every public-facing listing faithfully reflects the actual data for that family.

Deliverables

Clean, corrected set of listings for every Family ID:

Accurate structured data (city, county, household size, household members, wishlist).

Corrected family story / description, formatted using the provided prompt/code.

Change log file documenting:

Family ID

Type of error(s) found

Correction made

If applicable: CSV or spreadsheet ready for import back into the website.

How to Apply

In your proposal, please:

Briefly describe your experience with:

Data cleanup / QA

Excel/Google Sheets

Any work with Shopify or similar platforms

Confirm you are available to start immediately and how many hours you can dedicate in the next 24–48 hours.

Tell me how you typically check for data integrity when two sources conflict (for example: applicant file vs website content).

If you’re the type of person who notices when a single field is wrong in a 500-row spreadsheet, this is your project.",CDD,Data Entry

We’re building a complete national contact database of dental offices and dental groups across the U.S. and are hiring a detail-oriented lead researcher to collect, enrich, and verify professional contact data for every decision maker at each location.

This is not simple data entry — it’s a precision-driven data sourcing and validation project. You’ll work from an existing master list of ~100,000 dental clinic domains and use multiple professional data tools to identify all decision makers per office or DSO (Dental Service Organization).

⸻

Responsibilities
	•	Work from an existing list of ~100,000 clinic websites.
	•	For each office or DSO, identify every relevant decision maker — including the dentist(s), associate dentist(s), office manager(s), and key administrative leaders.
	•	Use tools such as ZoomInfo, Apollo.io, SalesQL, Wiza, Hunter.io, and ListKit to gather and verify data.
	•	Collect the following for each verified contact:
	•	Full Name
	•	Exact Job Title
	•	Direct Professional Email
	•	Practice Email (info@ / contact@)
	•	Direct Phone Number (mobile/desk)
	•	Office Phone Number
	•	LinkedIn Profile URL
	•	Associated Practice or DSO Name
	•	Consolidate results into a structured spreadsheet (multiple contacts per office where applicable).
	•	Validate emails and phone numbers for accuracy and deliverability.
	•	Remove duplicates and cross-check against internal data to avoid overlap.

⸻

Target Roles

Climate Data Index Developer Needed,United States,Posted 4 weeks ago,2025-11-07T20:38:56.761Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Climate-span-class-highlight-Data-span-Index-Developer-Needed_~021986896170785187181/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"I’m looking for an experienced developer or data scientist to build a simple MVP that creates a historical climate variability index using publicly available NOAA datasets.

The goal is to develop a working Python prototype that automatically processes multiple NOAA climate datasets and combines them into a single trend indicator showing how key global climate variables have changed over time.

The project will focus on aligning several long-term datasets—air temperature, sea surface temperature, precipitation, and tropical storm activity—comparing each to a modern baseline period, and generating a single composite time series.

Deliverables:

-  Retrieve and process four core NOAA datasets (air temperature, sea surface temperature, precipitation, tropical storms).

- Align all datasets to a common time window (1979 to 2025).

- Use the 1991 to 2020 period as the “normal” baseline for comparison.

- Calculate how much each year (1979 to 2025) differs from the average during 1991 to 2020 for each variable.

- Standardize these differences so all variables are on the same numerical scale (e.g., z-scores).

- Combine all standardized variables using equal weighting to produce a single composite index.

- Output a time-series dataset and a simple line chart showing how the index changes from 1979 to 2025.

- Provide a fully commented Jupyter notebook or Python script that reproduces the results step-by-step.

I’m looking for an experienced Python data analyst or data scientist to complete a modeling task that follows detailed technical specifications.
The project focuses on predicting flight delays using a historical dataset and comparing three predictive techniques.
Please read the full instructions carefully — I need the work to strictly follow these details and be fully reproducible.

⚙️ General Notes

Use the flight delay dataset (CSV file provided).

Drop the variable Weather.

Treat all remaining variables as categorical.

Use 20% of data for the test partition.

Use 5-fold cross-validation for model selection.

When encoding categorical variables, drop the dummy corresponding to the mode value of each predictor.

The main performance measure is AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve).

🧩 Part 1: Classification Tree

Set maximum tree depth = 8.

Use cross-validation to select the best pruned tree based on AUC.

Report and include:

The final level of depth of the best tree.

Whether the tree used the full allowed depth (and explain why or why not).

Choose one leaf node and show the predicted probability of being delayed — include the calculation.

Write down the top 3 effective English rules of the tree.

Rank the rules in order of their significance.

If you had to report one rule, specify which and justify your choice.

Report the AUC of the best tree on the test partition.

🔍 Part 2: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Use cross-validation to select the best model based on AUC.

Set max_k = 200.

Report and include:

The optimal value of k.

Explain the potential risk when k = 1.

Report the AUC of the chosen model on the test partition.

📈 Part 3: Logistic Regression

Use cross-validation to select the best logistic regression model based on AUC.

Parameters:

min_alpha = 0.001

max_alpha = 100

n_candidates = 1000

max_iter = 2000

Report and include:

The optimal penalty level (alpha) of the final model.

The AUC of this model over the test partition.

⚖️ Part 4: Model Comparison

Compare the test-partition AUCs from the three models:

Classification Tree

k-NN

Logistic Regression

State clearly which technique performs best.

💡 Part 5: Short Conceptual Question

Briefly explain (3–5 sentences):
In what situations is AUC a better predictive performance measure than accuracy, and why?

📦 Deliverables

A Google Colab (.ipynb) notebook with working Python code for all tasks (a–m).

All outputs printed clearly (no screenshots required).

Include brief explanations in comments or Markdown cells.

The code must be original and manually written —
no ChatGPT, Copilot, or automated code generation.

🧠 Skills Required

Strong proficiency in Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and data visualization.

Knowledge of cross-validation, AUC metrics, and classification models.

Ability to write clean, commented code and follow complex instructions precisely.

Nice to Have

– Experience with Azure, Fabric, Microsoft 365 integration

We run a legal-information chatbot for domestic violence survivors and need a senior Google Cloud plus Python data engineer to build a secure, PII-aware data pipeline from raw text transcripts to anonymized text, then into BigQuery metrics, and finally a basic dashboard for grants.

This is primarily a data engineering and ETL role, with light analytics on top using BigQuery SQL and Looker Studio.

MUST-HAVE SKILLS (IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE)

Please only apply if you are strong in all of these:

1. Google Cloud Platform – BigQuery, GCS, IAM (senior level)
   - Designing and populating BigQuery tables for analytics
   - Loading data into BigQuery from Python
   - Designing GCS buckets, prefixes, lifecycle rules
   - Creating and using service accounts with least-privilege IAM

2. Python ETL and data pipelines (senior level)
   - Parsing semi-structured text files into structured records
   - Building small, reliable pipelines with logging, error handling, and configuration files
   - Comfortable working on a secure Mac environment (local scripts calling GCP)

3. PII detection and anonymization (strong experience)
   - Hands-on with Microsoft Presidio or similar tools
   - Combining regular expressions and NER to mask names, phone, email, addresses, case numbers, and similar data
   - Understands how to keep city, state, age and resource names while removing direct identifiers

4. LLM JSON extraction (Vertex AI preferred)
   - Calling an LLM from Python, ideally Vertex AI
   - Designing prompts that return strict JSON according to a known schema
   - Handling invalid JSON, retries, and logging failures safely

5. BigQuery SQL and basic BI (intermediate–senior)
   - Writing queries for monthly summaries and KPI tables
   - Understanding fact vs summary tables
   - Comfortable wiring BigQuery into a simple Looker Studio dashboard (we don’t need fancy design—just clear numbers and charts)

Nice-to-have:
- Looker Studio experience beyond basics
- Streamlit or Hex dashboards (for possible future phase)
- Work with sensitive domains (healthcare, legal, DV, mental health)

PROJECT OVERVIEW

We have:
- About 18 months of chatbot transcripts, roughly 500 conversations per month. Some conversations are very long, up to 100+ pages.
- A detailed technical spec (v1.1) describing the architecture.
- A 59-metric dictionary for what we want to extract.

You will implement a v1 pipeline:
- Secure Mac environment (Python + Presidio)
- -GCS buckets (raw, clean, metrics-json)
- -Vertex AI (one call per conversation)
- -BigQuery (conversations fact table + monthly_summary)
- -Looker Studio dashboard connected to those tables

The architecture is mostly defined, but we are open to your expert suggestions if they lower complexity, cost, or risk.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND DELIVERABLES

A. GCP Setup

- Create and configure GCS buckets, for example:
  - raw (raw .txt with PII, 90-day retention)
  - clean (anonymized conversations)
  - metrics-json (per-conversation metrics JSON)
- Create BigQuery dataset (for example, “statutefinder”) with:
  - conversations table (per conversation)
  - optional messages table (per message)
  - monthly_summary table or view
- Set up service accounts and IAM roles following least-privilege principles.

B. Script 1 – upload_to_gcs.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Upload local .txt transcript exports to path like:
  gs://raw-bucket/YYYYMMDD/filename.txt
- Log which files were uploaded and where.

C. Script 2 – anonymize_and_parse.py (runs on secure Mac)

- Read raw transcripts from GCS or local storage (pattern to be agreed).
- Split into individual conversations using the known delimiter line “CONVERSATION #” plus the header block.
- Parse and preserve header fields: ID, DATE, LOCATION, MODEL.
- Apply regular expressions and Presidio to redact PII in the conversation body:
  - survivor, abuser, and children names
  - phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, case/docket numbers, etc.
  - keep city, state, country, ages, and clearly “resource” organization names (courts, shelters)
- Write sanitized conversations back to the clean bucket as .txt or .json files.
- Nice-to-have: produce a CSV listing detected entities per conversation for human review.
- Important: reuse or extend our existing Presidio anonymizer from our GitHub organization (we will share the repo).

D. Script 3 – extract_metrics_to_bq.py

- Read anonymized conversations from clean bucket.
- Compute structural metrics such as message counts, word counts, abandoned conversations, etc.
- For each conversation, call Vertex AI once with an external prompt file to extract:
  - legal topics, abuse types, statutes mentioned
  - booleans such as protection order discussed, safety plan delivered, shelter guidance provided, emergency referral suggested
  - primary language
- Enforce valid JSON output and implement minimal retry with logging when the model returns malformed JSON.
- Write combined metrics JSON to metrics-json bucket.
- Load rows into BigQuery conversations table, including:
  - conversation_id, date/time, location fields, structural metrics, LLM metrics
  - batch_id, processed_at, metrics_prompt_version
- Ensure idempotency so the same conversation_id is not inserted twice.

E. Aggregations and Dashboard Hook

- Write BigQuery SQL to create or refresh monthly_summary from conversations.
- Optionally configure a scheduled query (for example, monthly).
- Help connect BigQuery to Looker Studio and build a simple v1 dashboard page:
  - headline metrics
  - topic breakdown
  - map by state
  Clarity matters more than design polish.

F. Documentation

- README.md with setup and run instructions for Scripts 1–3.
- SECURITY.md summarizing buckets, IAM, lifecycle rules, anonymization flow (high-level).
- METRICS_GUIDE.md explaining how stored/derived fields map to the 59-metric dictionary (we provide the sheet).
- requirements.txt listing Python dependencies (Presidio, Google Cloud client libraries, Vertex AI SDK, etc.).

CONSTRAINTS AND PRACTICAL NOTES

- Data volume: about 500 conversations per month; some conversations are very long.
- Budget: around 500 USD fixed price for this v1 scope.
- Timeline: target 3–4 weeks.
- The secure anonymization environment is a dedicated, encrypted Mac controlled by us.

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- We export a new text transcript batch on the Mac.
- We run your scripts or trigger the flow.
- New rows appear in conversations; monthly_summary is updated.
- The Looker Studio dashboard refreshes and shows the new month’s numbers.
- We do not re-run the LLM on older conversations.
- Raw PII only lives in the raw bucket and is auto-deleted after its retention period.

HOW TO APPLY

Start your proposal with the word “METRICS” so we know you read this.

In 4–6 short paragraphs, please answer:

1. GCP and BigQuery example – describe one project where you built a pipeline using GCS and BigQuery. What was your role, and what did the pipeline do?

I'm looking for a skilled freelancer to automate the creation of ""virtual color analysis"" reports. 

WHAT WE DO AND WHAT IS COLOR ANALYSIS?:
- Overall, we help women / men feel more beautiful by telling them the colors that most compliment their skin tones.
- We do this by analyzing hair color, contrast levels, eye color, vein color, freckles, and overall complexion. 
- Once we do the analyzation, we give the person a ""season"" which they fall into.. There are 12 seasons in color analysis. You can be a soft autumn, true winter, etc... Just look it up. The 12 season system. We have 12 canva templates. One for each season. 

For context: We have done this analysis session strictly in-person, but have recently pivoted to doing it virtually.

After someone purchases the virtual analysis, we automatically send them an intake form where they submit all of their necessary information and pictures.

Once we receive the intake form with all of the information, we would like the automation to decide what season the person is. Grok does this well if you submit the PDF of all of the information + pictures..

As mentioned, we have 12 templates for each season. Once the season is found, we need the persons photos and information uploaded in the necessary template.

Here is an example of our templates and a finished PDF:

TEMPLATE 1- https://www.canva.com/design/DAG3HSr2qAk/FQxGP5QzBd2SzH4MSCZWGA/edit?utm_content=DAG3HSr2qAk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton

TEMPLATE 2 (dark autumn example)- https://www.canva.com/design/DAG2YMKRXZc/H7ng3es4LD9FaIygHcgsEA/edit?utm_content=DAG2YMKRXZc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton

Finished PDF - https://www.canva.com/design/DAG4ROU22MM/EMeuMbl2vO2KJU9IHjRKJw/edit?utm_content=DAG4ROU22MM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton

In the finished PDF, you may notice there are also makeup recommendations. We have certain templates for those as well... Depending on the season the person falls into, the automation can add those templates as well. 

Our color analyst Paige will get the final sign off on the PDF to make sure the season and information is correct... And then once approved, Paige's assistant will email it to the person who purchased.

ALONG WITH THIS, we need a 2nd simple automation setup which does the following:
- Tracks purchases of the virtual analysis reports
- Tracks if the purchase who purchased submitted the intake form
- Track if the automation successfully completed the analysis
- Tracks if Paige approved
- Tracks if the PDF was sent out.

The total budget for this product is $300.",CDD,Automation

Target leads are not beginner “make money online” creators. We want creators who publish process-driven, operational, or tactical business content (BizOps, systems, marketing ops, CRO, paid ads, sales operations, automation, recruiting, finance, data) or talking-head breakdowns that directly promote a B2B offer. Solopreneurs are acceptable if their content ties to measurable business outcomes (client acquisition, fulfillment, hiring, positioning, systems). Do not source entertainment, faceless AI channels, lifestyle influencers, or pure beginner MMO creators.
Once the information is gathered, we need it sorted in a Google Sheet, which we then use for our outreach.
To start, we need 1,000 business leads gathered. For successful candidates, we will be needing at least 4,000 leads per month. You will be paid $200 per 1,000 leads per month. So for the full 4,000 per month we will give you $800 every month. This is ongoing long-term work.
3 months of work guaranteed. If you do a good job we will extend it to 12 months.
If you’re good, I will pay you more and give you even more work if you can handle it :)
You will be responsible for gathering the leads and information however you see fit, and you must use your own tools to gather the information and put them in a Google Sheet.
Open the sheet, make a copy, then fill it out with your trial work and send it back to me. DO NOT request to edit. There are a few example leads already on the sheet so you know exactly what kind of leads we are looking for.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P-aGrawBJBk1019RgXuEWsbx5zdV3GfmIaYlTXHfWN8/edit?usp=sharing

We will give bonuses for consistently good jobs. We will be requiring 5 leads as a free trial so we can see the quality of your work, but successful applicants can be confident they will have long-term consistent paid work.
Qualification criteria for the leads are:
Niche & Intent: Service-based B2B creators, agency owners, consultants, or operations/tech-for-business creators who use YouTube to demonstrate processes, frameworks, or business workflows that support a clear paid offer.


Exclude: beginner “make money online” creators, entertainment-first channels, faceless AI content, lifestyle/influencer content, and tutorial-only channels with no business behind them.


YouTube metrics: 100–50,000 subscribers, 1+ video in last 30 days, consistent business-related topics.


Business indicator (must have at least one): sales/landing page, paid community (Skool/Whop), visible calendar link, coaching/agency offer, or bio explicitly referencing outcomes/results.


Editing level: Basic-to-mid editing only (clean cuts, talking head, screen recordings, minimal graphics). Disqualify agency-level cinematic production, heavy motion graphics, multi-camera cinematic setups, or obvious AI-generated faceless channels.


Budget signal: Lead should show signs they can pay $2k/month (visual professionalism: real camera, pro lighting, branded background, consistent posting, clear premium offer). If channel signals low revenue (side-hustle, poor setup, no offer), disqualify.


Contact requirement: Must include at least one valid personal email address. If email is missing, search Instagram/LinkedIn/X or Hunter.io — if no email found, disqualify. Email bounce rate must be under 1% on our validation.

---

## **Project: Automate Lead Response-Time Tracking (Gmail + CallRail + Google Sheets)**

I need an automation built that tracks how fast we respond to new leads—specifically by measuring the time between when a lead arrives and when the first outbound call or callback is made.

### **Core Requirements**

1. **Lead Detection (with De-Duping)**

   * Parse incoming **lead notification emails in Gmail**.
   * **De-dupe** lead notifications (we often receive multiple copies for the same form fill).
   * Capture the timestamp of the **first unique** lead event only.

2. **Missed Call Detection (CallRail)**

   * Pull missed call events from **CallRail’s API**.
   * Use the missed call timestamp as the lead-received time for phone leads.

3. **Outbound/Callback Detection**

   * Detect the **first outbound call** or **first callback** to that lead (via CallRail).
   * Match by phone number or unique identifiers.

4. **Response-Time Calculation**

   * Compute the time difference between:

     * Lead received → first outbound call
     * Missed call → callback
   * Handle only the *first* call attempt.

5. **Google Sheets Logging**

   * Log all data into a **monthly data repository sheet**.
   * Auto-update an existing **MTD stats sheet** (already built).

### **Stack & Skills Needed**

* Gmail API or Apps Script (for parsing + de-duping)
* CallRail API (for missed calls + outbound call logs)
* Google Sheets automation (Apps Script or Python/n8n)
* LLM (we prefer gemini)

### **Deliverables**

* Fully functional automation
* Clean monthly data logging
* MTD dashboard automatically updating
* Documentation for maintenance",CDD,Google Apps Script

"🪵 Collect 1,000 Google Street View Images of Utility Poles (Damage Classification for AI Training)",USA,Posted 2 weeks ago,2025-11-17T19:44:38.963Z,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Collect-000-Google-Street-View-Images-Utility-Poles-Damage-Classification-for-Training_~021990506385695170004/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,"We’re building an AI system for automated utility pole inspection. To train our model, we need 1,000 clear Street View screenshots of wooden utility poles from around Michigan and similar U.S. regions.

You will use Google Street View to capture poles that are close, clear, and fully visible from base to top, then assign one label to each image. PRIORITIZE CLOSE POLES that fill most of the frame.

Classification labels (choose exactly one per image):
• Normal pole – upright, straight, no visible damage.
• Cracked pole – visible cracks/splits/rot; dark discoloration, missing chunks.
• Leaning pole – clearly tilted from vertical; looks off-plumb.
• Warped pole – bent/bowed/twisted; not straight even if not “leaning.”
(Optional) Vegetation obstructed – only if the pole is mostly hidden by trees/brush.

How to capture:

1. Open Google Maps → Street View.
2. Move along the street with arrows; find a wooden pole.
3. Zoom in to get close. Keep the pole centered, sharp, and fully visible if possible.
4. Take a screenshot.
5. Save as JPEG ONLY. Do not use PNG, HEIC, or WebP. JPEG ONLY.

File naming:
city_label_index.jpeg
Examples: detroit_cracked_001.jpeg, annarbor_normal_056.jpeg
Important: JPEG ONLY (file extension .jpeg or .jpg).

Deliverables:
• 1,000 total screenshots, roughly balanced across the four labels (~250 each).
• A CSV with columns: filename, city, state, gsv_url (optional), label, notes.
• Upload all files to Google Drive or Dropbox.
• Images must be JPEG ONLY (no PNG/HEIC/WebP).

Quality criteria:
• Pole centered and sharp; width at least 640 px.
• Closer poles preferred over distant ones.
• Variety of neighborhoods, lighting, and angles.
• Avoid metal or concrete poles; avoid faces, license plates, private driveways.

Budget and hiring plan:
• $50 fixed price per freelancer for 1,000 images each.
• Hiring 6 freelancers total (≈6,000 images overall).
• Expected time: 2–3 days per batch.

Training video (watch first):
(https://www.loom.com/share/ae7b1032499445d59fd071bb8cbcc097)

Application questions:

1. Have you used Google Street View before? Share a link/example.
2. When can you deliver a 10-image pilot (2 per label)?
3. Do you confirm you will submit JPEG ONLY images and the CSV as described?


Example cities to explore:
Detroit, Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, Flint, Lansing, Toledo, South Bend, Cleveland suburbs. Variety across regions is encouraged.

Bonus points:
Include a few different zoom levels (close and medium). Add metadata such as Street View capture date if visible. Clean, diverse examples increase the chance of re-hire.

A B2B marketplace is making revenue decisions blind.

They know:

- Total MRR (from Stripe)
- Number of trials (from Stripe)
- Number of calls (scattered across Calendly + sales rep notes)

They DON'T know:

- Which marketing channels actually drive revenue (not just signups - REVENUE)
- Which customer segments convert best (agencies? brands? creators?)
- If trials perform better than sales calls (attribution is broken)
- Why deals are lost (objections are captured in random Slack DMs)

Your job: Design a tracking system that answers these questions.

Not just ""build a Sheet.""

Design the logic, validate the approach, THEN build it.

What We've Started (Your Starting Point)

We've built a Google Sheet template with 12 tabs:

Trials, Customers, Churn, Calls, Sources, Segments, etc.
It's attached. But we're not sure:
- Is this structure right?
- Are we tracking the right things?
- Will the attribution logic actually work?
- Are there gaps we're not seeing?

That's where you come in.

The Core Questions You'll Answer

1. Attribution Logic

Customer signs up from Google Ad → starts trial → books call → closes on call → pays.
Who gets credit? Google Ad? Trial? Call?

You design: Attribution model (first/last/weighted/custom), explain why, structure Sheet to support it, write the logic.

2. Segmentation Strategy

Users answer onboarding: content strategy, budget, experience, business type.

We need: Which segments convert best? Highest LTV? Revenue by segment by source?

You design: How to capture this in Sheet, formulas for ""MRR by segment by source"", edge case handling.

3. Source Tracking

Sources: Stacks, SEO, UGC, Twitter, Podcast, YouTube, Paid ads.

Challenge: Some have UTMs, some don't. Some book calls directly. Some sign up then call later.

You design: First/last touch tracking, handle unknowns, Sheet structure, Zapier flows.

4. Call Funnel

Lead books (Calendly) → call happens → rep logs outcome (show/no-show, closed/lost, objections) → if closed, Stripe payment.

Track: Lead→Book→Show→Close rates by source/segment, revenue per call, common objections.

You design: Calls tab structure, link calls→customers→revenue, objection tracking, edge cases.

5. Dashboard Metrics

They need to answer: Which channel to invest in? Which segment converts best? Are we improving? Where's the revenue leak?

You design: What metrics matter, overview/sources/segments tab structures, formulas.

What We're Looking For

Strategic thinker who:
- Asks ""why"" before ""how""
- Challenges our structure
- Proposes better approaches
- Explains trade-offs

Attribution expert who:

Hi,

I’m Chief of Staff at InsideSuccess.TV
 An innovative startup with big goals and rapid growth.

We're working with famous celebs and entrepreneurs to build the Netflix of Business TV, amongst other things.

I’m seeking someone hungry, talented, that wants to learn and grow with me.

Disclaimer: This is an intense, high-expectation work environment. It is not for most people. It is challenging. But if you thrive in chaos and understand the growth value of working in challenging environments , this may be the place for you.

This job ad is for two different versions of this role (your choice):
Option 1 – AI Tools & Workflow Builder (This is mostly just building AI tools and workflows)

Option 2 – Operations Assistant & AI Integration  (This includes option 1 + but you will be working closer and more dynamically with me across all departments)

I really just need someone who can build simple AI tools. But if you aspire for a more dynamic role, let me know. 

Option 1 – AI Tools & Workflow Assistant
Focus: Build small internal AI tools and workflows that solve concrete problems.

-Example 1: Tool to upload a folder of photos and generate AI images in bulk for marketing assets.

-Example 2: Tool to analyze sales call transcripts and suggest what a top rep would have said instead.

-Connect tools like Google Drive, Zoom transcripts, Monday.com, Slack, and AI models using automation platforms.

-You should be comfortable with “vibe coding” – hacking together simple scripts, no-code/low-code workflows, or basic apps (e.g., using APIs, Python, JavaScript, or tools like n8n/Zapier/Make) to make things work, even if you’re not a formal software engineer.

-You don’t need deep CS knowledge, but you must be able to read and tweak code snippets, follow technical docs, connect APIs, debug simple errors, and iterate quickly on small internal tools.

-Occasionally, organize, clean, and label data.

-Light admin as needed: targeted research on tools/methods, occasional email checks, and data entry. 

Option 2 – Operations & AI Integration Assistant 
This includes all of option 1, but also working as my operational partner across all departments. 

What you might do (on top of Option 1):
-Operational Mapping & Playbook
Help build our centralized “Operational Playbook” using diagramming tools (likely Miro).

-Map how work, information, and decisions move between departments.

-Brain storm and trouble shoot innovative solutions to problems.

-Work with me to go department by department, clarifying workflows, handoffs, and responsibilities, and eventually managing people. 

-Independently working directly with department heads to implement AI tools and better processes.

-Keep systems and documentation updated as processes evolve.

-Take on high-leverage “random” ops tasks that change day to day and remove friction from how we operate.



Job Details
1. Required Hours: Mon-Fri, 9:00am-5pm EST.

However, I’m looking for someone who will put in the extra work when needed, like the rest of us do.

2. $1200/mo salary

Requirement:
If interested, please answer these 8 short questions below.

I’m not going to read anything AI-generated.

Questions To Answer:
1. Are you applying for option 1, option 2 or both. 

2. If you could have ANY job/career in the world what would it be? Like what is your dream job? (There's no wrong answers. Be honest, don’t try to say something you think I want to hear, as I promise you don’t know.)

3. Tell me what you are currently learning about on your own. It DOES NOT need to be work-related. (1 sentence)

4. Why do you think you are better than the other applicants, like why are you different? (1-2 sentences)

5. What is something impactful you used AI for? (1 sentence)

6. Share 1 of your favorite quotes, it can be about anything.

7. What is the thing you have done that you are proudest of, or had the biggest impact in your previous role/s (1-2 sentences)

8. Who are you as a person, like what energizes you and makes you tick?  (1-2 sentences)

9. Anything else you want to share, any tools you’ve built not in your profile?. (Optional)

We will have one 20-minute interview, maybe 2 at most, but probably 1. 

If selected you will begin working asap.",CDD,Generative AI

I’m looking for a detail-oriented virtual assistant / list-building specialist to research bankruptcy attorneys and law firms in the United States and build a targeted prospect list for Google Maps (Google Business Profile) marketing.

You will use a tool called LeadSnap (free account) to identify the best prospects in specific cities based on their local map rankings.

What You’ll Be Doing

Create a free LeadSnap account
- Sign up for a free account at LeadSnap (I can provide basic guidance/training material).
- Log in and familiarize yourself with the interface, especially the heatmap / ranking report feature.

Search for bankruptcy law firms in specific cities
- Use LeadSnap to search for “bankruptcy attorney” / “bankruptcy lawyer” in targeted U.S. cities (I will provide the city list, e.g., major metros like Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Miami, etc.).
- Focus only on businesses that clearly appear to be bankruptcy attorneys / bankruptcy law firms (not general businesses or unrelated practice areas).

Identify “good but not perfect” prospects
- For each law firm, run or review a LeadSnap ranking / heatmap around the firm’s office location.
- I’m specifically looking for firms that:
     Have multiple rankings of position 5 or higher (i.e., positions 7 –20) around their office “bubble”  The higher the number, the better
- Are not already dominating the map pack everywhere (if they’re #1 everywhere around them, skip them)

In other words, we want law firms that:
- Don't rank welll, but
- Still have room for improvement and could benefit from local SEO / maps optimization.

Collect data and build a clean list (minimum 300 firms)
For each qualifying firm, collect the following information into a spreadsheet (Google Sheets or Excel):

Law Firm Name

Attorney Name (if visible)

Practice Area: Bankruptcy (or “Bankruptcy & [Other]”)

City & State

Website URL

Google Business Profile / Google Maps URL

Main Phone Number

Public Email Address (if available on website or GBP)

LeadSnap Ranking Details:

Average ranking position

Number of grid points / locations with rankings 5 or higher

Notes (optional): anything relevant, such as “also does personal injury” or “multiple locations”

Target:

At least 300 unique bankruptcy law firms that match the ranking criteria.

Deliverables

A spreadsheet (Google Sheets or Excel) with at least 300 qualifying law firms, with all fields above completed as much as possible.

A brief summary of:

Which cities you covered

Approximate number of firms per city

Any difficulties or patterns you noticed (for example: some cities had very few bankruptcy firms that met the criteria).

Ideal Freelancer

Strong internet research and data entry skills

Comfortable using SaaS tools / web apps (training for LeadSnap will be provided)

Experience with lead generation, list building, or digital marketing research is a big plus

Good written English

Reliable, detail-oriented, and able to follow instructions closely

If the work is high quality, this can turn into ongoing projects (additional cities and practice areas).",CDD,Data Entry

I have a Google Sheet used for managing pharmacy purchasing data.
In the sheet’s Applications Menu, there’s a custom option called “Update Pharmacy Data” — this triggers a popup listing multiple pharmacies and allows importing or updating their usage data into the master tab.
This functionality currently works perfectly for ~20–30 existing pharmacies.

The problem:
I’ve recently added new columns and started working with a new pharmacy group. I need to link this new group’s usage spreadsheet to the main Google Sheet so that it appears in the “Update Pharmacy Data” popup and imports usage data correctly.

However:
There’s an Apps Script project behind this sheet that uses a library called “Operators”.
There’s a “Credentials” tab, but it’s blank.
The existing pharmacy list must be coming from another location (possibly a hidden tab, named range, external config sheet, or script property).

I need help finding where this mapping is stored and then adding the new pharmacy’s URL/ID correctly so it can be imported like the others.


I’m looking for someone who can:
Inspect the Apps Script and the linked Operators library to locate where the pharmacy-to-spreadsheet mapping is stored.
Explain the logic briefly (so I understand it for future additions).
Add my new pharmacy group’s sheet to that mapping so it appears in the “Update Pharmacy Data” popup and imports correctly.
Optionally, help tidy up the setup (documenting where new pharmacies should be added in future).


Skills needed:
Strong experience with Google Apps Script
Understanding of custom menus, dialogs, and external spreadsheet imports
Ability to debug scripts using external libraries and named ranges
