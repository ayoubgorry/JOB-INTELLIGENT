Translate research into pragmatic wins for our platform.

Partner with stakeholders: clear visuals, crisp narratives, and method presentation for analysts, clinicians, and executives.

Requirements

Passionate about AI's potential in healthcare; outcomes-oriented with a focus on impact, not just research.

Statistics: parametric and non-parametric tests, hypothesis testing, experimental design, confidence intervals, and causal inference basics.

ML fluency: Python, SQL; polars (or pandas), scikit-learn, XGBoost/LightGBM (PyTorch/transformers a plus); survival/time-to-event experience is great.

Here at Tarro we build products that empower small brick and mortar restaurants by liberating them of the operational burden of running their business. We accomplish this by providing a frictionless connection between them and their customers through our multi-product ecosystem offering AI-enabled order taking, delivery enablement, payment solutions, and point-of-sale software. At Tarro, we use a combination of bits (technology) and atoms (people) to solve real world problems facing small business owners.

We obsess over placing our customers first and working backwards from there. When our customers succeed, we succeed. The restaurant industry in the US is over a $1 trillion total addressable market (TAM), but remains relatively underserved by technology. Large chains are able to afford expensive tech that gives them a huge advantage; we believe that small restaurant owners deserve access to the same technologies at an affordable price.

Tarro has been profitable for nearly a decade and seen 5x revenue growth in the last three years. As of our last fundraising round in mid-2022, we were valued at $450M and have since seen substantial growth across customer acquisition, product development and company headcount. Thousands of loyal restaurants have entrusted Tarro with their success, and together we have supported nearly 20 million customers. We are proud to be named one of Built In’s top companies to work for in 2023.

You are not a traditional data scientist. You sleep, eat, and breath Excel and R, but are tired of working task lists in a slow-moving corporation. You enjoy the process of discovering new data challenges, and want the freedom to create meaningful solutions in real-time. You are constantly learning, teaching yourself new disciplines, and you are obsessed with the potential uses of neural networks, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. You want the autonomy and responsibility that comes with being the company’s go-to resource for all-things data.

In this role, you will translate complex business challenges into data tasks – our managers and clients know what’s wrong, and it is up to you to investigate in the data, determine the cause, and devise an elegant solution. You will continually refine your models to learn from increasing amounts of available information. You will decide what data points should be silently corrected, vs. highlighted with intuitive suggestions. This suggestion engine will be the foundation of the company’s core product.

As the quality of data improve, your role will increasingly shift towards predictive analytics – using platform data to drive the high-level business strategies of our clients.

You’ll be a skills fit if you:

have significant experience using AI toolkits such as TensorFlow, Pylearn2, and Pattern
have significant experience building and training models using web services such as Amazon Rekognition, IBM Watson, and Google CloudVision

enjoy the challenges and rewards of working in a *very* early stage startup (very strong preference for someone who has worked in a <50-person company).
are constantly tinkering (we love tinkerers!).
enjoy challenging the status quo, and constantly come to your team with ideas for improvement.
know when to check in for approval vs. run with an idea.
view working for a large corporation as the death of productivity, innovation, intellectual stimulation, education, and pretty much any other goal of a company/job.
do not sit idle once a task is complete – you have a constant backlog of tasks, or things you want to learn.
have worked in a variety of team environments – distributed, remote, off-shore, near-shore, etc.
think that TCP/IP is one of the most under-appreciated accomplishments of modern computing.
want to create (and I really mean *create*) a fun, hard-working environment of peers with whom you’re excited to slay the day.
don’t get wrapped up in titles, and chip in on things that need doing without asking (even if they have absolutely nothing to do with your responsibilities).

What you get:

Outstanding benefits, including fully-paid health insurance, 401k, commuter benefits, generous vacation, BYOD compensation, etc.
Flexible work environment – e.g. working from home, shifted hours, etc.

Inherent curiosity and analytical follow-through. You can't help but ask why and love using data and logic to explore potential solutions.
A self-starter mentality with the ability to prioritize, meet deadlines, and identify opportunities with limited oversight.
Exceptional data storytelling abilities, as well as the ability to articulate technical information to a non-technical audience.
Operating in a team-first environment with excellent collaboration and communication skills.
You are motivated by our mission. We are working to solve the biggest problems in mental health care today (access and affordability).

An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, SEI-ers possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, they connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI-ers frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI-ers are ethical and trustworthy individuals who consistently and repeatedly follow through, and hold true to their values in difficult situations. SEI-ers have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others. As every project is different, an SEI-er must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. SEI-ers define ambition differently. They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable. SEI-ers enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends, and family.

Traditional finance and crypto-enabled finance are merging into digital finance — an open, global financial system for everyone. Stripe and is launching its own blockchain after acquiring Privy and Bridge. JPM is getting involved with stablecoins. Robinhood launched tokenized stocks and its own blockchain.

Finance and is moving onchain and its accelerating.

Previously platforms like Bloomberg, CapIQ, and FactSet became the information layer on top of finance, growing into $1–$10B ARR businesses. But these platforms weren’t built for a crypto-native world.

Artemis is building the open data platform for digital finance — organizing and standardizing the metrics that matter for blockchains, tokens and stablecoins, all in one place.

Functionally, we offer a “Bloomberg-like” Terminal trusted by Visa, Circle, Tether, Grayscale, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Solana, Base, and others — alongside Excel plugins, APIs, and Snowflake Data Shares used by some of the world’s largest asset managers.

Our mission is to make crypto’s promise of an open financial system real and to empower anyone, anywhere, to become a world-class investor in digital finance.

Who We Are

""Humans wanted for hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger. Safe return doubtful. Honor and recognition in case of success” — Ernest Shackleton, Antarctic Explorer

In this role you will be a “full stack data engineer”, shipping features end-to-end to the Artemis terminal as well as building a scalable data platform that allows any analyst to do the same.

Build the best open and free dashboards in the industry: we have an open Terminal that anyone in the world can use to understand what’s happening onchain. Your work will contribute to the free and open information system that digital finance will rely on.

Push the crypto industry forward: Our mission is to bring first principle and long term thinking to crypto. That means giving the industry the best damn data they have ever seen and helping them understanding what they’re seeing.

Build a name for yourself: We want everyone on our data team to be thought leaders in the space. We don’t just want you to build the free data dashboards - we want you to tweet about it + share your knowledge with the rest of the community.

Customer Obsessed: At Artemis we work with the leading capital allocators in the space everyday (from multi-trillion dollar asset managers to leading liquid token funds). We take their feedback seriously and want you to build your own relationship with our clients and help push the space forward with them.

You are not a traditional data scientist. You sleep, eat, and breath Excel and R, but are tired of working task lists in a slow-moving corporation. You enjoy the process of discovering new data challenges, and want the freedom to create meaningful solutions in real-time. You are constantly learning, teaching yourself new disciplines, and you are obsessed with the potential uses of neural networks, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. You want the autonomy and responsibility that comes with being the company’s go-to resource for all-things data.

In this role, you will translate complex business challenges into data tasks – our managers and clients know what’s wrong, and it is up to you to investigate in the data, determine the cause, and devise an elegant solution. You will continually refine your models to learn from increasing amounts of available information. You will decide what data points should be silently corrected, vs. highlighted with intuitive suggestions. This suggestion engine will be the foundation of the company’s core product.

As the quality of data improve, your role will increasingly shift towards predictive analytics – using platform data to drive the high-level business strategies of our clients.

You’ll be a skills fit if you:

have 5+ years of experience using R, Python, Excel VBA, Apache Spark, Eclipse Deeplearning4j, and similar libraries
have significant experience using AI toolkits such as TensorFlow, Pylearn2, and Pattern
have significant experience building and training models using web services such as Amazon Rekognition, IBM Watson, and Google CloudVision
have experience with image recognition, and image content identification
routinely identify high-value data issues, explain their business impact to senior executives, and devise an elegant solution to the problem

You’ll be a character fit if you:

enjoy the challenges and rewards of working in a *very* early stage startup (very strong preference for someone who has worked in a <50-person company).
are constantly tinkering (we love tinkerers!).
enjoy challenging the status quo, and constantly come to your team with ideas for improvement.
know when to check in for approval vs. run with an idea.
view working for a large corporation as the death of productivity, innovation, intellectual stimulation, education, and pretty much any other goal of a company/job.
do not sit idle once a task is complete – you have a constant backlog of tasks, or things you want to learn.
have worked in a variety of team environments – distributed, remote, off-shore, near-shore, etc.
think that TCP/IP is one of the most under-appreciated accomplishments of modern computing.
want to create (and I really mean *create*) a fun, hard-working environment of peers with whom you’re excited to slay the day.
don’t get wrapped up in titles, and chip in on things that need doing without asking (even if they have absolutely nothing to do with your responsibilities).

What you get:

Outstanding benefits, including fully-paid health insurance, 401k, commuter benefits, generous vacation, BYOD compensation, etc.
Flexible work environment – e.g. working from home, shifted hours, etc.
Potentially, equity shares in the company, depending on your experience
The unique experience, pride and status that comes from being one of the first employees of a software startup
The opportunity to build your own team as we expand, and shape the entire company/product
The opportunity to “do it right” this time. We have all inherited someone else’s mess at some point, and wished we could build something from scratch to meet our own impeccable standards. It’s time to seize the opportunity.",FullTime,Data & Database Occupations

The Data Scientist is distinguished from the Predictive Data Analyst in that the latter applies well-established analytic principles, methods, and procedures within existing data systems and architectures to complete well-defined, routine to moderately difficult functions and projects, whereas Data Scientists may develop or assist in developing new analytic methods, functions, and data architectures as necessary to complete complex projects, including those involving unstructured data.

Positions in this class differ from those that plan, design, conduct and evaluate research projects involving complex experimental designs and data analysis, programming and processing of data, and preparing reports and recommendations based on research findings, in that these classes do not employ machine learning or big data as part of their analyses.

FIRST DAY OF FILING:
The application filing period will begin on Thursday, July 17, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. (PT) - Continuous.
We will keep accepting applications until the position is filled. The application window may close unexpectedly once we have enough qualified candidates.

The LA County Board of Supervisors recently declared a local state of emergency for homelessness (Download PDF reader), and the County is working to revise and expand our response to help all who are affected. We are looking for qualified and passionate individuals to help us in the mission of addressing issues like housing, mental health, and substance use. If you are looking for a new career that will directly benefit the population of LA County, this may be the opportunity for you.

The County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health is seeking qualified candidates to fill emergency Data Scientist vacancies related to the homelessness crisis.

Under the emergency order, applicants who meet the requirements may be hired for an initial period of up to 90 days, with an opportunity for permanent County employment.

Before the end of your initial work period, you will be assessed on your work performance. This assessment will be weighted 100%.

Those who successfully pass the assessment will be considered for permanent appointment to Data Scientist.

The Data Scientist positions are located within the Evaluation Section of the Health Outcomes and Data Analytics (HODA) Division of the Substance Abuse Prevention & Control (SAPC) Bureau. The Data Scientist will support data collection and evaluation of services for the CalAIM JI Initiative. The Data Scientist will handle local and state data reports, evaluate program effectiveness (e.g., treatment linkage, timely access, care coordination), and collaborate closely with SAPC’s System of Care, IT, Sage Management Divisions, and external stakeholders.

DEFINITION:

Under general supervision, develops and applies methods to identify, collect, process, organize, and analyze structured and unstructured data using statistical prediction, inference, and optimization; effectively communicates results to County, departmental, and divisional decision makers to support data-driven program design and management.

CLASSIFICATION STANDARDS:

This is the second working level in the professional data science/analysis series. Positions allocable to this class work under the general direction of a Data Science Supervisor or supervisor or manager responsible for the data analytics, research, or statistical function of a department, independently performing duties of considerable difficulty to complete moderately complex projects or major aspects of large/complex projects that may be divisional, departmental, or Countywide in scope. Incumbents deploy techniques such as data extraction, transformation, and loading; classical statistical analysis and machine learning, including predictive and prescriptive modeling and optimization; and data visualization, to generate critical information and knowledge and effectively communicate findings to technical and nontechnical stakeholders to support data-driven program design, management, and decision-making. Incumbents work with data sets characterized by large volume, moderate complexity, and significant heterogeneity, integrating data from various sources, requiring direct collaboration with data engineers and other IT staff to design and provide feedback on data systems and processes necessary to support their work.

Data Scientist is distinguished from the Senior Data Scientist in that the latter applies subject-matter expertise to identify new and emerging business problems, whereas the Data Scientist works under general supervision to develop methods of interrogating data in order to solve previously identified business problems. The Data Scientist is distinguished from the Predictive Data Analyst in that the latter applies well-established analytic principles, methods, and procedures within existing data systems and architectures to complete well-defined, routine to moderately difficult functions and projects, whereas Data Scientists may develop or assist in developing new analytic methods, functions, and data architectures as necessary to complete complex projects, including those involving unstructured data.

Positions in this class differ from those that plan, design, conduct and evaluate research projects involving complex experimental designs and data analysis, programming, and processing of data, and preparing reports and recommendations based on research findings, in that these classes do not employ machine learning or big data as part of their analyses.

We’ve worked with Samsung, Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, and other large, important entities you’ve probably heard of. Our work environment is fantastic for aspiring coders, calculators, and entrepreneurs. Also, we have neither VC, nor PE, nor other acronyms funding us. We have a weird business model where we sell our work for a profit and use those profits to pay people (I told you it was weird!). We then reinvest those profits into our promising research on AI alignment and our ambitious internal skunkworks projects. We previously sold one of our skunkworks for some number of millions of dollars.

We have made a name for ourselves in cutting-edge brain computer interface (BCI) R&D, and we are making a name for ourselves in our research and policy efforts on AI alignment. We want to optimize for human agency, if you feel similarly, please apply to support our efforts. Data scientists will have the opportunity between client projects to work on important alignment research, with the opportunity to potentially have your research project prioritized if particularly promising.

Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year (if you're based in LA). Not in the range? That's fine, you can still apply and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring for right now, since we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

RECRUITING NOTE

There are an increasing number of scammers out there that are taking advantage of our company's name to scam people with fake offers that result in you ultimately giving the scammers money. Please make sure anyone who contacts you is contacting you from the domains ae.studio, agencyenterprise.com, agencyenterprisestudio.com (please make sure that the sender really is from those domains). If you have any questions about any interviews or offers you might have received and seem bogus, please contact recruiting-offers@ae.studio.

Equity

Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.

At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.

Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.

We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.

* Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.",Full-time,Data & Database Occupations

Agentio enables marketers to buy creator led ads as easily and scalably as Meta or Google ads—automating sourcing, pricing, contracting, delivery, and measurement with AI—so work that took months now happens in minutes.

We’re on a mission to transform a $800B digital ad ecosystem by shifting digital ad spend into the hands of creators. That means better outcomes for marketers and enabling creators to live off their work—finally being paid in proportion to the value they create. That shift is accelerating: Unilever’s CEO has said the company will move roughly half of its ad budget into social and creators—Unilever is among the world’s largest advertisers, spending around $9–10B annually. As these dollars move, they need performance-grade pipes; Agentio is how those dollars flow to creators with the speed, control, and measurement marketers expect. We enable brands like Uber, DoorDash, and Bombas to run creator campaigns with the same rigor, control, and accountability as their core performance channels.

Agentio has raised $56M to date at a $340M valuation, including a recent Series B led by Forerunner, which followed our Series A within a calendar year. Our investors also include Benchmark, Craft, and AlleyCorp. Agentio has been named to Forbes’ Next Billion Dollar Startups, 2025, and our platform is already used and loved by the world’s leading marketers and creators. We are just getting started!

Data is Our Growth Engine

Our platform routes budgets to the right creators, at the right price, with clear attribution. We ingest rich first-party signals across creative briefs, audiences, content, and outcomes; link them to conversions; and train LLM-driven ranking and pricing models that guide every step—from discovery and acceptance likelihood to pacing and scale. Each campaign feeds back new data, creating a compounding learning loop that makes matching, forecasting, and measurement more efficient with every use.

We’re expanding our data practice and hiring foundational teammates. Whether you analyze behavior, model outcomes, run experiments, or build robust data and ML tooling, you’ll have an immediate impact—shaping product decisions, improving measurement, and delivering the pipelines and services that power the platform.

At Agentio, data drives decisions—what we build, how we price, and where we scale—so creators and brands win together. If you’re curious, collaborative, and excited to own outcomes in a fast-moving environment, let’s talk.

You

Nimble, hungry, humble, and adaptive to change

Excited to learn and grow in a fast-paced environment

Proven track record of applying analytical/statistical methods to tackle real-world problems using big data.

A true problem-solver and self-starter, with incredible ambition and drive

Competitive and highly motivated to exceed expectations

Ready to roll up your sleeves, get things done, and work harder than you’ve likely ever worked before — with far greater reward

A positive, honest, empathetic, and curious teammate

You understand that Agentio is building in-person, and is in-office 5 days/week

What You'll Get

The opportunity to build a first-of-its kind business as an early team-member and make a meaningful impact in the way brands share their stories and creators live off their work.

Crash-course in what it takes to scale a start-up with first-hand exposure to the different foundational business drivers and needs.

The chance to work with an exceptional team and help build our engineering culture

A collaborative, transparent, and engaging work environment.

An AI-first business model: Our approach is distinctly enabled by AI, but our business will get stronger (not commoditized) as foundation models improve. We are building durability through two-sided network effects that will compound over time.

Top tier investors: With the traction to support conviction in our model, we raised significant funding from investors (Thrive Capital and General Catalyst) to build an exceptional team of engineers and operators.

We’re looking for you if you have:

Able to bring clarity to ambiguous problems and lead projects with major strategic/business impact, collaborating across teams and levels to drive sound decisions.

Data Scientist,"United States, US",a year ago,2024-11-23,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/aestudio/jobs/4011756004,AE STUDIO,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Ae-Studio,"We are a development, data science and design studio that works closely with founders and executives to create custom software and machine learning solutions.

AE Studio builds products, platforms, and internal ventures that increase agency for all conscious beings. We combine world-class software engineering, AI expertise, and product design to ship ambitious projects that matter.

About the Role

As a Data Scientist at AE Studio, you’ll work on a mix of client projects and internal research initiatives. You’ll solve real-world problems, help build meaningful products, and contribute to groundbreaking AI alignment research. Your work will involve building data-driven solutions, leveraging machine learning models, and using your creativity to deliver results that matter.

In addition to client projects, you’ll have the opportunity to propose and pursue high-impact research projects, especially those aligned with our mission of increasing agency. Promising projects could even become prioritized skunkworks initiatives.

We want problem-solvers who are adaptable, collaborative, and excited to push boundaries. If this sounds like you, let’s talk.

About You

You thrive on solving challenging problems and bring a mix of technical expertise, creativity, and humor to your work. You enjoy working independently but also love collaborating with a team that shares your passion for making a difference.

Required Skills and Experience
Fluency in Python..
Experience with LLM lifecycle: prompt design/engineering, prompting techniques (RAG, few-shot, CoT, etc.), vector databases, multimodality, fine-tuning, and evaluation.
Proven data science experience: You’ve been a key contributor to impactful projects and know how to deliver results with real-life outcomes.
Statistical & causal ML fundamentals: expertise in experimental design, uncertainty quantification, and rigorous model evaluation across tabular, time-series, and foundation-model fine-tuning tasks.
Deep learning experience: Expertise in building/training NLP or computer vision models with PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX.
Agile & AI-powered development: You run lean Kanban/Scrum cycles and leverage AI-powered tools like Cursor to prototype quickly and ship high-impact solutions.
Growth mindset: You embrace challenges, value progress over perfection, and constantly seek to improve.
Self-management: You can work independently, take ownership of projects, and deliver without constant oversight.
Product and UX understanding: You care about delivering a seamless, user-friendly experience.
Effective communication in English: Clear, concise, and maybe even witty communication is essential.
Bonus Points for
Self-managed projects: Ideally something that you helped develop from zero and shipped to real users.
Startup experience: You thrive in dynamic environments and enjoy taking on new challenges.
Client relationship management: Experience managing clients and delivering excellent results.
Passion for AI alignment: You care deeply about humanity’s future and want to help navigate the challenges of advancing AI.
What We Offer
Remote-first culture: Work from anywhere, or join us in one of our offices.
Flexible schedules: We care about outcomes, not micromanagement.
Competitive pay: Regular performance-based raises and a diversified employee equity program.
Opportunities for growth: Work on cutting-edge R&D and propose projects that could become our next skunkworks focus.
Supportive environment: A team that collaborates, mentors, and shares knowledge.
Perks: Health insurance, free lunches (at the office), weekly knowledge-sharing talks, and an annual team retreat.

Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year (if you're based in LA). Not in the range? That's fine, you can still apply and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring for right now, since we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

Equity

Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.

At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.

Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.

We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.

* Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.",Remote,Data & Database Occupations

Middesk makes it easier for businesses to work together. Since 2018, we’ve been transforming business identity verification, replacing slow, manual processes with seamless access to complete, up-to-date data. Our platform helps companies across industries confidently verify business identities, onboard customers faster, and reduce risk at every stage of the customer lifecycle.

Middesk came out of Y Combinator, is backed by Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners, and was recently named to Forbes Fintech 50 List and cited as an industry leader in business verification by digital identity strategy firm, Liminal.

NYNHP Short-Term Research Scientist Position
The New York Natural Heritage Program (NYNHP) is seeking a Biodiversity Data Researcher to assess the impacts of invasive species on native biodiversity for a short-term, project-based appointment. In collaboration with NYNHP science staff and regional invasive species managers, the Biodiversity Data Researcher will analyze decades of data collected on rare species, significant natural communities, and invasive species in New York State to quantify impacts to biodiversity and provide information to stakeholders that aids in strategic invasive species management decisions.

NYNHP has been documenting conditions of and threats to rare species and significant natural communities across the state for 40 years. NYNHP has also been managing invasive species data from all stakeholders for the state for 15 years. Throughout New York State, there are currently over 17,000 documented locations of rare species and over 350,000 observations of invasive species. An initial spatial analysis of these extensive spatial datasets shows that 28% of documented rare species occurrences are co-located with invasive species observations. However, not all species intersections will be impactful depending on species' biology or site-characteristics.

The Biodiversity Data Researcher will work collaboratively with NYNHP staff to design analytical approaches to assess the impacts of invasives on rare species and significant natural communities using NYNHP datasets and other data resources such as external observation databases, spatial datasets (such as aerial imagery), historical information (such as museum specimens), or quantitative field surveys. The researcher will also develop data products and management guidance, informed by analyses and the needs conveyed by an advisory group of stakeholders. Findings will be synthesized and published.

NYNHP works in partnership with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and other state, federal and private organizations involved in natural resource management and advancing the conservation of biodiversity. For more information visit www.nynhp.org. This position is based out of the DEC Central Office in Albany, NY, and provides access to SUNY-ESF resources remotely, such as library and software access. A hybrid work schedule can be considered.

Duties:

Compile and analyze information on invasive species impacts to rare species from internal and public databases, scientific literature, site-based species lists and assessments, and other relevant sources.
Develop analytical approaches to quantify impacts on rare species occurrences (and over time when available) and to prioritize conservation efforts.
Convene meetings with NYNHP staff, regional invasive species managers, and other stakeholders throughout project to collaboratively refine goals and interpret results.
Incorporate findings into accessible online tools for use by natural resource managers to protect rare species and significant natural communities.
Develop additional products for field scientists and natural resource stewards such as 1) data collection methods for documenting invasive species impacts and native biodiversity recovery at management sites; and 2) compiling guidance for avoiding harm to sensitive native species while managing invasive species.
Communicate results to stakeholders and the broader scientific community via presentations, research-to-practice reports, and peer-reviewed publications.

Job Requirements:

Required Qualifications:

Graduate degree (M.S. or PhD) in ecology, conservation biology, landscape ecology, plant ecology, botany, natural resources, geography, forestry, or a related field.
Experience analyzing and interpreting scientific data and large spatial datasets.
Strong communication skills for synthesizing and presenting results to technical and non-technical audiences.
Knowledge of regional fauna and flora, natural communities, ecosystems, ecosystem processes, and their conservation needs.
Self-motivation, with the ability to work independently while collaborating within a multidisciplinary team

Preferred Qualifications:

TYPE OF RECRUITMENT:
OPEN COMPETITIVE - EMERGENCY

FIRST DAY OF FILING:
The application filing period will begin on Thursday, July 17, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. (PT) - Continuous.
We will keep accepting applications until the position is filled. The application window may close unexpectedly once we have enough qualified candidates.

The LA County Board of Supervisors recently declared a local state of emergency for homelessness (Download PDF reader), and the County is working to revise and expand our response to help all who are affected. We are looking for qualified and passionate individuals to help us in the mission of addressing issues like housing, mental health, and substance use. If you are looking for a new career that will directly benefit the population of LA County, this may be the opportunity for you.

The County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health is seeking qualified candidates to fill emergency Data Scientist vacancies related to the homelessness crisis.

Under the emergency order, applicants who meet the requirements may be hired for an initial period of up to 90 days, with an opportunity for permanent County employment.

Before the end of your initial work period, you will be assessed on your work performance. This assessment will be weighted 100%.

TYPE OF RECRUITMENT:
OPEN COMPETITIVE - EMERGENCY

FIRST DAY OF FILING:
The application filing period will begin on Thursday, July 17, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. (PT) - Continuous.
We will keep accepting applications until the position is filled. The application window may close unexpectedly once we have enough qualified candidates.

The LA County Board of Supervisors recently declared a local state of emergency for homelessness (Download PDF reader), and the County is working to revise and expand our response to help all who are affected. We are looking for qualified and passionate individuals to help us in the mission of addressing issues like housing, mental health, and substance use. If you are looking for a new career that will directly benefit the population of LA County, this may be the opportunity for you.

The County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health is seeking qualified candidates to fill emergency Predictive Data Analyst vacancies related to the homelessness crisis.

Under the emergency order, applicants who meet the requirements may be hired for an initial period of up to 90 days, with an opportunity for permanent County employment.

Before the end of your initial work period, you will be assessed on your work performance. This assessment will be weighted 100%.

Those who successfully pass the assessment will be considered for permanent appointment to Predictive Data Analyst.

The Predictive Data Analyst positions are located within the Evaluation Section of the Health Outcomes and Data Analytics (HODA) Division of the Substance Abuse Prevention & Control Bureau. The Predictive Data Analyst will assist with the design, development, and planning implementation of evaluation services and highly complex data science projects which will significantly contribute to the overarching goals of optimizing program effectiveness, ensuring regulatory compliance, and promoting health equity within the managed care framework.

DEFINITION:

Under immediate supervision, assists in maintaining and analyzing County, departmental, or divisional data assets; utilizes classical and machine learning techniques, including predictive and prescriptive analytics, to support data-driven program design and management; and produces dashboards, reports, and other advanced data visualization products to help program managers monitor outputs and outcomes.

CLASSIFICATION STANDARDS:

This is the first working level in the professional data science/analysis series. Positions allocable to this class work under the immediate supervision of a Data Scientist Supervisor, or supervisor or manager responsible for the data analytics, research, or statistical function of a department, to analyze and maintain the quality of County, departmental, or divisional data assets. Incumbents perform regular quality-assurance analysis upon relevant data sets and work with data administrators and other information technology staff to establish data pipelines and identify issues in need of correction.

Utilizes advanced statistical techniques and methodologies to analyze large-scale service utilization data (e.g., service utilization by CPT codes, level of care, and provider type, and agency) to predict at-risk and high utilizers and risk performance areas, and initiating other projects.

Utilizes big data collected via Sage in addition to Census, and Medical Eligibility Data System (MEDS) data to conduct predictive/prescriptive data modeling that will inform SAPC leadership to make better financial, business, policy and operational decisions in managing costs, utilization, and quality of care as well as financial risk management.

Incumbents work with data sets characterized by large volume, moderate complexity, and significant heterogeneity, integrating data from various sources, requiring direct collaboration with data engineers and other IT staff to design and provide feedback on data systems and processes necessary to support their work.

Data Scientist is distinguished from the Senior Data Scientist in that the latter applies subject-matter expertise to identify new and emerging business problems, whereas the Data Scientist works under general supervision to develop methods of interrogating data in order to solve previously identified business problems. The Data Scientist is distinguished from the Predictive Data Analyst in that the latter applies well-established analytic principles, methods, and procedures within existing data systems and architectures to complete well-defined, routine to moderately difficult functions and projects, whereas Data Scientists may develop or assist in developing new analytic methods, functions, and data architectures as necessary to complete complex projects, including those involving unstructured data.

Positions in this class differ from those that plan, design, conduct and evaluate research projects involving complex experimental designs and data analysis, programming and processing of data, and preparing reports and recommendations based on research findings, in that these classes do not employ machine learning or big data as part of their analyses.

Training a quantile regression model to forecast the distribution of SMB revenues and precisely size our financing offers

Applying convex optimization to generate competitive financing offers

Our team consists of the best developers, data scientists, researchers, and founders. We do all sorts of projects, always of the quality that makes our clients sing our praises.

We’ve worked with Samsung, Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, and other large, important entities you’ve probably heard of. Our work environment is fantastic for aspiring coders, calculators, and entrepreneurs. Also, we have neither VC, nor PE, nor other acronyms funding us. We have a weird business model where we sell our work for a profit and use those profits to pay people (I told you it was weird!). We then reinvest those profits into our promising research on AI alignment and our ambitious internal skunkworks projects. We previously sold one of our skunkworks for some number of millions of dollars.

We have made a name for ourselves in cutting-edge brain computer interface (BCI) R&D, and we are making a name for ourselves in our research and policy efforts on AI alignment. We want to optimize for human agency, if you feel similarly, please apply to support our efforts. Data scientists will have the opportunity between client projects to work on important alignment research, with the opportunity to potentially have your research project prioritized if particularly promising.

ABOUT YOU
Experience with ML or alignment research
You care about AI alignment, and are optimistic in humanity’s capacity to problem solve and safely navigate accelerating AI capabilities and have an awesome future
Eager to use AI and automate everything you do
Comfortable working in a fast-paced, startup-like environment
Proven data science experience–primary or equal contributor, multiple smaller projects, management of stake-holders.

Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year (if you're based in LA). Not in the range? That's fine, you can still apply and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring for right now, since we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

RECRUITING NOTE

There are an increasing number of scammers out there that are taking advantage of our company's name to scam people with fake offers that result in you ultimately giving the scammers money. Please make sure anyone who contacts you is contacting you from the domains ae.studio, agencyenterprise.com, agencyenterprisestudio.com (please make sure that the sender really is from those domains). If you have any questions about any interviews or offers you might have received and seem bogus, please contact recruiting-offers@ae.studio.

Equity

Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.

At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.

Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.

We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.

* Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.",Full-time,Data & Database Occupations

Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year (if you're based in LA). Not in the range? That's fine, you can still apply and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring for right now, since we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

Equity

Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.

At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.

Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.

We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.

* Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.",Remote,Data & Database Occupations

An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation.

DATA SCIENTIST / EMERGENCY APPOINTMENT HOMELESSNESS,"United States, US",5 months ago,2025-07-16,https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/lacounty/jobs/4776440/data-scientist-emergency-appointment-homelessness,County of Los Angeles,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/County-of-Los-Angeles,"EXAM NUMBER:
PH1763C-EA

TYPE OF RECRUITMENT:
OPEN COMPETITIVE - EMERGENCY

FIRST DAY OF FILING:
The application filing period will begin on Thursday, July 17, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. (PT) - Continuous.
We will keep accepting applications until the position is filled. The application window may close unexpectedly once we have enough qualified candidates.

The LA County Board of Supervisors recently declared a local state of emergency for homelessness (Download PDF reader), and the County is working to revise and expand our response to help all who are affected. We are looking for qualified and passionate individuals to help us in the mission of addressing issues like housing, mental health, and substance use. If you are looking for a new career that will directly benefit the population of LA County, this may be the opportunity for you.

The County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health is seeking qualified candidates to fill emergency Data Scientist vacancies related to the homelessness crisis.

Under the emergency order, applicants who meet the requirements may be hired for an initial period of up to 90 days, with an opportunity for permanent County employment.

Before the end of your initial work period, you will be assessed on your work performance. This assessment will be weighted 100%.

Those who successfully pass the assessment will be considered for permanent appointment to Data Scientist.

The Data Scientist positions are located within the Evaluation Section of the Health Outcomes and Data Analytics (HODA) Division of the Substance Abuse Prevention & Control (SAPC) Bureau. The Data Scientist will support data collection and evaluation of services for the CalAIM JI Initiative. The Data Scientist will handle local and state data reports, evaluate program effectiveness (e.g., treatment linkage, timely access, care coordination), and collaborate closely with SAPC’s System of Care, IT, Sage Management Divisions, and external stakeholders.

DEFINITION:

Under general supervision, develops and applies methods to identify, collect, process, organize, and analyze structured and unstructured data using statistical prediction, inference, and optimization; effectively communicates results to County, departmental, and divisional decision makers to support data-driven program design and management.

CLASSIFICATION STANDARDS:

This is the second working level in the professional data science/analysis series. Positions allocable to this class work under the general direction of a Data Science Supervisor or supervisor or manager responsible for the data analytics, research, or statistical function of a department, independently performing duties of considerable difficulty to complete moderately complex projects or major aspects of large/complex projects that may be divisional, departmental, or Countywide in scope. Incumbents deploy techniques such as data extraction, transformation, and loading; classical statistical analysis and machine learning, including predictive and prescriptive modeling and optimization; and data visualization, to generate critical information and knowledge and effectively communicate findings to technical and nontechnical stakeholders to support data-driven program design, management, and decision-making. Incumbents work with data sets characterized by large volume, moderate complexity, and significant heterogeneity, integrating data from various sources, requiring direct collaboration with data engineers and other IT staff to design and provide feedback on data systems and processes necessary to support their work.

Data Scientist is distinguished from the Senior Data Scientist in that the latter applies subject-matter expertise to identify new and emerging business problems, whereas the Data Scientist works under general supervision to develop methods of interrogating data in order to solve previously identified business problems. The Data Scientist is distinguished from the Predictive Data Analyst in that the latter applies well-established analytic principles, methods, and procedures within existing data systems and architectures to complete well-defined, routine to moderately difficult functions and projects, whereas Data Scientists may develop or assist in developing new analytic methods, functions, and data architectures as necessary to complete complex projects, including those involving unstructured data.

Positions in this class differ from those that plan, design, conduct and evaluate research projects involving complex experimental designs and data analysis, programming, and processing of data, and preparing reports and recommendations based on research findings, in that these classes do not employ machine learning or big data as part of their analyses.

Essential Job Functions

Handles data requests from California and Los Angeles County Correctional Facilities regarding individual’s substance use disorder (SUD) treatment history by verifying Releases of Information (ROI) and conducting data mining and analysis across multiple datasets in Sage (e.g., screening/assessments, CalOMS, claims) to respond timely and effectively; maintains transparency through detailed records of all data requests, analyses, and outcomes.
Develops and implement advanced data science projects to evaluate CalAIM JII’s effectiveness by analyzing key metrics such as treatment linkage, timely access, professional-to-professional warm hand-off, and care coordination outcomes. Collaborates with SAPC divisions and stakeholders to provide data insights for strategic decisions, program improvement, and impact maximization.
Contributes to the design and continuous improvement of data collection methods and performance indicators for pre-release and post-release services, ensuring effective coordination with Correctional Facility Pre and post-release Care Managers.
Utilizes advanced statistical and machine learning methods to uncover trends, predict outcomes, and inform interventions. Develop and maintain dashboards and reports to present findings to stakeholders and program leadership.
Uses analytical software (e.g., SAS, R, Python), other computer languages (e.g., SQL), data visualization tools (e.g., SAS Visual Analytics, Power BI, Tableau), and advanced data visualization techniques to develop and present data visualizations of findings and recommendations from evaluation and predictive modeling projects to support SAPC’s data-driven policy and operational decisions for SAPC’s CalAIM JII implementation.

Senior Data Scientist,"United States, US",a year ago,2024-11-22,,"Syndic8 Data Management Services, LLC","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Syndic8-Data-Management-Services,-LLC","You:

You are not a traditional data scientist. You sleep, eat, and breath Excel and R, but are tired of working task lists in a slow-moving corporation. You enjoy the process of discovering new data challenges, and want the freedom to create meaningful solutions in real-time. You are constantly learning, teaching yourself new disciplines, and you are obsessed with the potential uses of neural networks, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. You want the autonomy and responsibility that comes with being the company’s go-to resource for all-things data.

In this role, you will translate complex business challenges into data tasks – our managers and clients know what’s wrong, and it is up to you to investigate in the data, determine the cause, and devise an elegant solution. You will continually refine your models to learn from increasing amounts of available information. You will decide what data points should be silently corrected, vs. highlighted with intuitive suggestions. This suggestion engine will be the foundation of the company’s core product.

As the quality of data improve, your role will increasingly shift towards predictive analytics – using platform data to drive the high-level business strategies of our clients.

You’ll be a skills fit if you:

have 5+ years of experience using R, Python, Excel VBA, Apache Spark, Eclipse Deeplearning4j, and similar libraries
have significant experience using AI toolkits such as TensorFlow, Pylearn2, and Pattern
have significant experience building and training models using web services such as Amazon Rekognition, IBM Watson, and Google CloudVision
have experience with image recognition, and image content identification
routinely identify high-value data issues, explain their business impact to senior executives, and devise an elegant solution to the problem

You’ll be a character fit if you:

enjoy the challenges and rewards of working in a *very* early stage startup (very strong preference for someone who has worked in a <50-person company).
are constantly tinkering (we love tinkerers!).
enjoy challenging the status quo, and constantly come to your team with ideas for improvement.
know when to check in for approval vs. run with an idea.
view working for a large corporation as the death of productivity, innovation, intellectual stimulation, education, and pretty much any other goal of a company/job.
do not sit idle once a task is complete – you have a constant backlog of tasks, or things you want to learn.
have worked in a variety of team environments – distributed, remote, off-shore, near-shore, etc.
think that TCP/IP is one of the most under-appreciated accomplishments of modern computing.
want to create (and I really mean *create*) a fun, hard-working environment of peers with whom you’re excited to slay the day.
don’t get wrapped up in titles, and chip in on things that need doing without asking (even if they have absolutely nothing to do with your responsibilities).

What you get:

Outstanding benefits, including fully-paid health insurance, 401k, commuter benefits, generous vacation, BYOD compensation, etc.
Flexible work environment – e.g. working from home, shifted hours, etc.
Potentially, equity shares in the company, depending on your experience
The unique experience, pride and status that comes from being one of the first employees of a software startup
The opportunity to build your own team as we expand, and shape the entire company/product
The opportunity to “do it right” this time. We have all inherited someone else’s mess at some point, and wished we could build something from scratch to meet our own impeccable standards. It’s time to seize the opportunity.",FullTime,Data & Database Occupations

PH1762B-EA

TYPE OF RECRUITMENT:
OPEN COMPETITIVE - EMERGENCY

FIRST DAY OF FILING:
The application filing period will begin on Thursday, July 17, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. (PT) - Continuous.
We will keep accepting applications until the position is filled. The application window may close unexpectedly once we have enough qualified candidates.

The LA County Board of Supervisors recently declared a local state of emergency for homelessness (Download PDF reader), and the County is working to revise and expand our response to help all who are affected. We are looking for qualified and passionate individuals to help us in the mission of addressing issues like housing, mental health, and substance use. If you are looking for a new career that will directly benefit the population of LA County, this may be the opportunity for you.

The County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health is seeking qualified candidates to fill emergency Predictive Data Analyst vacancies related to the homelessness crisis.

Under the emergency order, applicants who meet the requirements may be hired for an initial period of up to 90 days, with an opportunity for permanent County employment.

Before the end of your initial work period, you will be assessed on your work performance. This assessment will be weighted 100%.

Those who successfully pass the assessment will be considered for permanent appointment to Predictive Data Analyst.

The Predictive Data Analyst positions are located within the Evaluation Section of the Health Outcomes and Data Analytics (HODA) Division of the Substance Abuse Prevention & Control Bureau. The Predictive Data Analyst will assist with the design, development, and planning implementation of evaluation services and highly complex data science projects which will significantly contribute to the overarching goals of optimizing program effectiveness, ensuring regulatory compliance, and promoting health equity within the managed care framework.

DEFINITION:

Under immediate supervision, assists in maintaining and analyzing County, departmental, or divisional data assets; utilizes classical and machine learning techniques, including predictive and prescriptive analytics, to support data-driven program design and management; and produces dashboards, reports, and other advanced data visualization products to help program managers monitor outputs and outcomes.

CLASSIFICATION STANDARDS:

This is the first working level in the professional data science/analysis series. Positions allocable to this class work under the immediate supervision of a Data Scientist Supervisor, or supervisor or manager responsible for the data analytics, research, or statistical function of a department, to analyze and maintain the quality of County, departmental, or divisional data assets. Incumbents perform regular quality-assurance analysis upon relevant data sets and work with data administrators and other information technology staff to establish data pipelines and identify issues in need of correction. Incumbents use major statistical programming languages and packages to deploy well-established machine learning and advanced data visualization techniques to complete well-defined, routine-to-moderately-difficult functions and projects. Incumbents may oversee smaller or more routine projects and contribute to larger, more complex projects overseen by a Data Scientist or Senior Data Scientist.

Predictive Data Analyst is distinguished from the higher-level Data Scientist in that the latter independently completes moderately complex data science projects or major aspects of large/complex projects, which may include developing new analytic methods, functions, or data architectures, whereas Predictive Data Analysts apply well-established analytic principles, methods, and procedures within existing data systems and architectures to complete well-defined, routine-to-moderately-difficult functions and projects.

Positions in this class differ from those that plan, design, conduct and evaluate research projects involving complex experimental designs and data analysis, programming and processing of data, and preparing reports and recommendations based on research findings, in that these classes do not employ machine learning or big data as part of their analyses.

Essential Job Functions

Conducts predictive data assignments for Behavioral Health Quality Improvement Projects (BHQIP) and performance improvement projects (PIPs) mandated by the state and External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) by identifying areas for improvement within SAPC's programs and services through complex data analysis and performance metrics.

Collaborates with Sr Data Scientist, program managers, patients, stakeholders, and provider network members to develop and implement strategies to address identified areas of improvement and enhance program effectiveness and efficiency.

Assists with the program performance evaluation, ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements, fidelity, outcomes and effectiveness of various funding programs and grants including CalWORKs and General Relief, Measure H, Behavioral Health Bridge Housing (BHBH), Assembly Bill (AB) 109, Care First and Community Investment, Block Grants, and state or federal grant awards.

Utilizes advanced statistical techniques and methodologies to analyze large-scale service utilization data (e.g., service utilization by CPT codes, level of care, and provider type, and agency) to predict at-risk and high utilizers and risk performance areas, and initiating other projects.

Utilizes big data collected via Sage in addition to Census, and Medical Eligibility Data System (MEDS) data to conduct predictive/prescriptive data modeling that will inform SAPC leadership to make better financial, business, policy and operational decisions in managing costs, utilization, and quality of care as well as financial risk management.

Data Scientist,"United States, US",a year ago,2024-11-23,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/aestudio/jobs/4011756004,AE STUDIO,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Ae-Studio,"We are a development, data science and design studio that works closely with founders and executives to create custom software and machine learning solutions.

AE Studio builds products, platforms, and internal ventures that increase agency for all conscious beings. We combine world-class software engineering, AI expertise, and product design to ship ambitious projects that matter.

About the Role

As a Data Scientist at AE Studio, you’ll work on a mix of client projects and internal research initiatives. You’ll solve real-world problems, help build meaningful products, and contribute to groundbreaking AI alignment research. Your work will involve building data-driven solutions, leveraging machine learning models, and using your creativity to deliver results that matter.

In addition to client projects, you’ll have the opportunity to propose and pursue high-impact research projects, especially those aligned with our mission of increasing agency. Promising projects could even become prioritized skunkworks initiatives.

We want problem-solvers who are adaptable, collaborative, and excited to push boundaries. If this sounds like you, let’s talk.

About You

You thrive on solving challenging problems and bring a mix of technical expertise, creativity, and humor to your work. You enjoy working independently but also love collaborating with a team that shares your passion for making a difference.

Required Skills and Experience
Fluency in Python..
Experience with LLM lifecycle: prompt design/engineering, prompting techniques (RAG, few-shot, CoT, etc.), vector databases, multimodality, fine-tuning, and evaluation.
Proven data science experience: You’ve been a key contributor to impactful projects and know how to deliver results with real-life outcomes.
Statistical & causal ML fundamentals: expertise in experimental design, uncertainty quantification, and rigorous model evaluation across tabular, time-series, and foundation-model fine-tuning tasks.
Deep learning experience: Expertise in building/training NLP or computer vision models with PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX.
Agile & AI-powered development: You run lean Kanban/Scrum cycles and leverage AI-powered tools like Cursor to prototype quickly and ship high-impact solutions.
Growth mindset: You embrace challenges, value progress over perfection, and constantly seek to improve.
Self-management: You can work independently, take ownership of projects, and deliver without constant oversight.
Product and UX understanding: You care about delivering a seamless, user-friendly experience.
Effective communication in English: Clear, concise, and maybe even witty communication is essential.
Bonus Points for
Self-managed projects: Ideally something that you helped develop from zero and shipped to real users.
Startup experience: You thrive in dynamic environments and enjoy taking on new challenges.
Client relationship management: Experience managing clients and delivering excellent results.
Passion for AI alignment: You care deeply about humanity’s future and want to help navigate the challenges of advancing AI.
What We Offer
Remote-first culture: Work from anywhere, or join us in one of our offices.
Flexible schedules: We care about outcomes, not micromanagement.
Competitive pay: Regular performance-based raises and a diversified employee equity program.
Opportunities for growth: Work on cutting-edge R&D and propose projects that could become our next skunkworks focus.
Supportive environment: A team that collaborates, mentors, and shares knowledge.
Perks: Health insurance, free lunches (at the office), weekly knowledge-sharing talks, and an annual team retreat.

Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year (if you're based in LA). Not in the range? That's fine, you can still apply and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring for right now, since we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

Equity

Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.

At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.

Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.

We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.

* Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.",Remote,Data & Database Occupations

Middesk makes it easier for businesses to work together. Since 2018, we’ve been transforming business identity verification, replacing slow, manual processes with seamless access to complete, up-to-date data.

AE Studio is an LA-based company focused on increasing human agency, primarily by making the imminent AGI future go well. Our team consists of the best developers, data scientists, researchers, and founders. We do all sorts of projects, always of the quality that makes our clients sing our praises.

We’ve worked with Samsung, Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, and other large, important entities you’ve probably heard of. Our work environment is fantastic for aspiring coders, calculators, and entrepreneurs. Also, we have neither VC, nor PE, nor other acronyms funding us. We have a weird business model where we sell our work for a profit and use those profits to pay people (I told you it was weird!). We then reinvest those profits into our promising research on AI alignment and our ambitious internal skunkworks projects. We previously sold one of our skunkworks for some number of millions of dollars.

We have made a name for ourselves in cutting-edge brain computer interface (BCI) R&D, and we are making a name for ourselves in our research and policy efforts on AI alignment. We want to optimize for human agency, if you feel similarly, please apply to support our efforts. Data scientists will have the opportunity between client projects to work on important alignment research, with the opportunity to potentially have your research project prioritized if particularly promising.

ABOUT YOU
Experience with ML or alignment research
You care about AI alignment, and are optimistic in humanity’s capacity to problem solve and safely navigate accelerating AI capabilities and have an awesome future
Eager to use AI and automate everything you do
Comfortable working in a fast-paced, startup-like environment
Proven data science experience–primary or equal contributor, multiple smaller projects, management of stake-holders.
Experience working with / building / training deep learning-based computer vision or NLP models or LLMs
Lots of experience with Python
Experience calling AI models’ APIs via REST or client libraries
Growth mindset. Excited about learning new things and solving difficult problems
Demonstrated ability to work independently/autonomously
Track record for breaking down complex problems into manageable chunks for individual or team execution
Full-time availability–but if you have cool side projects that increase human agency, we totally want you to keep working on it...we’ll even help!
Ability to communicate effectively and work exclusively in English and communicate complex technical concepts clearly to a non-technical audience
BONUS POINTS FOR
Experience with self-managed data science projects–show us your cool side hustles, especially if they increase human agency!
Experienced with software engineering best practices / software development background
Agile experience (worked with Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming)
JavaScript / Node.js experience
Experience managing clients and client relationships
Experience in startups
Being in LA to work in person from our amazing office

Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year (if you're based in LA). Not in the range? That's fine, you can still apply and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring for right now, since we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

RECRUITING NOTE

There are an increasing number of scammers out there that are taking advantage of our company's name to scam people with fake offers that result in you ultimately giving the scammers money. Please make sure anyone who contacts you is contacting you from the domains ae.studio, agencyenterprise.com, agencyenterprisestudio.com (please make sure that the sender really is from those domains). If you have any questions about any interviews or offers you might have received and seem bogus, please contact recruiting-offers@ae.studio.

Equity

Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.

At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.

Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.

We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.

* Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.",Full-time,Data & Database Occupations
